Trusts that earn less than $10,000 likely to be exempt from tax hike

The Government has detailed how it wants to exempt low-income earning trusts from a tax hike due to take effect on April 1.

It is proposing to ensure trusts that earn less than $10,000 a year continue to be taxed at 33 per cent, leaving those that earn more than this sum to be taxed at the new trustee rate of 39 per cent on all their income.

Last year, the Labour Government decided to lift the trustee tax rate from 33 to 39 per cent from the 2024-25 tax year.

It wanted to ensure the trustee rate aligned with the relatively new top income tax rate of 39 per cent, applied to income over $180,000. Labour was worried that if the two rates didnâ€™t align, people would use trusts to minimise their income tax bills.
