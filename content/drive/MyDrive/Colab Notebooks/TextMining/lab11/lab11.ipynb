comrade appropriately dubbed the commander the rookie and the guy with the cool accent discover the town resident slaughtered they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining resident head chopping alien possessed clutch filled with lovely overuse of storytelling flashback flash sideways and viewpoint change ghost of mar is hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequence the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of it story ripped straight from the page of 1970s zombie movie ghost leap from one convenient moment to the next stopping only to kill the character which are most convenient to lose attempt at character interaction and development are rare and forced most of these moment come off a kwik mart wisdom dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube with gun in one hand and dynamite cap in the other cube reminisces about his street life comparing the zombie stomping fun to me and my brother when we wa kid apparently crime in the bronx ha gotten so bad that the resident have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment but even in the film darkest moment fate conveniently lends hand supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifle and dynamite

and even if the nuke don get them the conveniently placed dynamite pack on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will in the end this film defines itself when our cop tribunal pronounces is that all you have to tell u for indeed john carpenter ha run out of thing to say and ha instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell ridiculously bad story\n","dreamworks

dialogue we are fully introduced to lester burnham kevin spacey 42 year old man trapped within his own life lester work for an advertising agency his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid life crisis he is suffering estranged from both his wife and his daughter lester start to crack under the stress his life becomes nothing more than series of mastubatory fantasy and sullen apathy carolyn burnham annette bening is the prototypical career woman homemaker she carefully tends her rose garden decorates her home with the best furnishing but inside she is desperate unsuccessful at her profession a real estate agent she drive herself into state of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family the third member of this anti family is jane burnham thora birch lester and carolyn daughter young girl going through the typical stage of adolescence but having to also come to term with her family growing dysfunction this funny and frightening slice of life is refreshingly simple not one character is given le than is needed to identify him or her some of the most telling character are those that serve to highlight other character most notably is barbara fitts allison janney the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts she ha almost no dialogue and seems to be either recovering from stroke or suffering from one colonel fitts chris cooper is an angry and frightened man his rage directed almost singularly at his son ricky wes bentley who ha just moved with his family to the same neighborhood a the burnham in fact they are the next door neighbor anymore detail into the personality of these marvelously diverse character would deprive one of the many pleasure and surprise to be had in american beauty alan ball who wa the co executive producer of the hit tv series cybil and creator of the new sitcom oh grow up ha fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplay to have hit the screen in the past ten year not one character in this film ring falsely and the depth of personality in each is achingly honest and insightful the plot detailing the last year in the life of man a he try to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original a to bring to mind such marvelous film work a the graduate or lolita kevin spacey turn in one of this year most pragmatic performance his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of life that is spiraling into old age finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he ha become lester try to return to his youth he quits his job actually blackmailing his employer for one year salary start smoking pot fantasizes about his daughter girlfriend angela mena suvari in marvelous performance here start working out and finally take job at the local fast food outlet mr spacey performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous that we can be certain that come oscar time we can be assured to see him name among the five nominee annette bening also turn in what may be the best performance of her career carolyn burnham is woman who ha become so insecure a to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy unable to cope with her growing disillusionment she force herself to maintain her demeanor driving her further and further into desperation adultery and possibly murder m bening make the character of carolyn so compelling a to be identifiable to almost anyone the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in word thora birch hold her own against the talent cast with her jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is dysfunctional family and rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parent should view a warning she is the prototypical trophy child when carolyn praise her daughter after performance by her cheerleading team m so proud of you honey you didn screw up once the bitterness and resentment are palpable thora birch is young actress to watch praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance colonel finn is man in complete denial his military upbringing masking desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend wes bentley a ricky finn is fine a the enigma the boy next door who may be more foe than friend deceitful and calculating young man whose voyeuristic proclivity mask deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adult around him mr bentley performance is the one troublesome note in the film that is simply because the character is such grand and complete liar that one almost fault the performance for it director sam mendes handle all of the particular of the cast and the setting with sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle scene of carolyn walking through the rain carry an ominous fission that call attention to the emotion of the character the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful capturing the season in all of it harsh beauty fall ha never looked so inviting yet depressing every nuance of american beauty begs it audience to think and examine it is film that will be discussed and debated for year to come and well it should a it is simply one of this year best\n","it is movie like these that make jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch based on the late 1960 television show by the same name the mod squad tell the tale of three reformed criminal under the employ of the police to go undercover however thing go wrong a evidence get stolen and they are immediately under suspicion of course the ad make it seem like so much more quick cut cool music claire dane nice hair and cute outfit car chase stuff blowing up and the like sound like cool movie doe it not after the first fifteen minute it quickly becomes apparent that it is not the mod squad is certainly slick looking production complete with nice hair and costume but that simply isn enough the film is best described a cross between an hour long cop show and music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and half and with it come every single clich it doesn really matter that the film is based on television show a most of the plot element have been recycled from everything we ve already seen the character and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden claire dane and omar epps deliver their line a if they are bored which really transfer onto the audience the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who play the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching unfortunately even he not enough to save this convoluted mess a all the character don do much apart from occupying screen time with the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset despite an american rating which the content doe not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset information on the character is literally spoon fed to the audience would it be that hard to show u instead of telling u dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable the way the film progress you likely won even care if the hero are in any jeopardy because you ll know they aren basing the show on 1960 television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable film based on television show can be counted on one hand even one that missing finger or two the number of time that checked my watch six is clear indication that this film is not one of them it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teen flick that we ve been seeing a of late avoid this film at all cost\n","moviemaking is lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era you ve got to know how to allocate your resource every dollar spent on free agent defensive tackle is one le dollar than you can spend on linebacker or safety or center in the nfl this lead to team like the detroit lion who boast superstar running back with huge contract but can only field five guy named herb to block for him in the movie you end up with film like spawn with huge special effect budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actor jackie chan is the barry sander of moviemaking he spin and dart across the screen like sander cutting back through the defensive line watching jackie in operation condor a he drive his motorcycle through the crowded street of madrid fleeing an armada of pursuer in identical black compact car is reminiscent of sander running for daylight with the chicago bear in hot pursuit except that sander doesn have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriage but like the lion star jackie doesn have anybody to block for him almost every cent that invested in jackie chan movie go for stunt and a chan doe his own stunt the rest of the money go to pay his hospital bill this leaf about 75 cent to pay for thing like director chan directs script and dubbing and supporting character not to mention the hideous title sequence this also explains why the movie wa shot in odd place like morocco and spain chan first release in this country rumble in the bronx wa supposedly set in new york but wa filmed in vancouver and in the chase scene the canadian rockies are clearly visible heck jackie doesn even have enough money for haircut look like much le personal hairstylist in condor chan play the same character he always played himself mixture of bruce lee and tim allen master of both kung fu and slapstick fu jackie is sent by the un to retrieve cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert and is chased by horde of neo nazi sympathizer and two stereotypical arab one of the thing like about jackie chan movie no political correctness he is joined by three woman who have little to do except scream jackie save u and misuse firearm the villain is an old nazi whose leg were broken in the secret base so that he ha to be carried everywhere and he more pathetic than evil en route we have an extended motorcycle chase scene hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo nazi and two confrontation with savage native once at the secret desert base there is long chop socky sequence followed by the film centerpiece wind tunnel fight that even better than the one in face off this is where the money wa spent on well choreographed kung fu sequence on giant kevlar hamster ball on smashed up crate of banana and on scorpion ignore the gaping hole in the plot how exactly if the villain leg were broken did he escape from the secret nazi base and why didn he take the key with him don worry about the production value or what exactly the japanese girl wa doing hitchhiking across the sahara just go see the movie operation condor ha pretentions of being raider of the lost ark knockoff but one wonder what jackie could do with the raider franchise blocking for him with lawrence kazdan screenplay john williams score spielberg directing and george lucas producing condor might be an movie however you ve got to go with what you ve got and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special talent that mainstream hollywood should could and ought to utilize\n","he back and it about time wa the motto for this television series pilot call it pilot don care what fox network say revival of the cult classic british tv show doctor who that spawned no series which mean there are no smart network exec out there not exactly news to lot of people know the motto wa well chosen the series wa simple it wa about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen life who traveled around in type forty spaceship called tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddie including the evil daleks and the master who appears in this feature played very badly by eric robert a good a this revival wa there is something missing from it to make sure it wa really doctor who is it the acting hell no paul mcgann is just a good a any of the other seven guy who ve played the doctor including his predecessor and off screen friend sylvester mccoy who appears once more for the regeneration scene he look right for the role is brilliant actor and slip effortlessly into the role the way my two favorite jon pertwee and tom baker would daphne ashbrook brings class to her role a dr grace holloway the doctor first companion that he kiss on screen she is not your typical female companion who scream and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor she is tough spunky american and ashbrook show this well young yee jee tso show promise a chang lee and ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually play the punk kid who dy at the end this film included which imho waste his talent the only problem with the acting is eric robert one time he had to say to mcgann doctor always dress for the occasion but he broke it up and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like song lyric always dress for the occasion you need an actor le slow and le reliant on moving his hand to act and who also british like mcgann is a the doctor executive producer phil segal said he wa casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role dunno who thought of casting him but if they re reading this news flash eric robert is not star he ride on his sister coattail and any hit movie he make ha nothing to do with him is this problem the kiss to the past they have reference to the show so subtle that non fan would not notice them only whovians would and they re good is it the script or the movie a whole the script is classy piece of work featuring master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue and the movie a whole is one fan will love and it is good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series so what is it simple no plot the master on his last leg sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him the doctor attempt to take his remains back to gallifrey but they accidentally land in san francisco 1999 december 31 where the master with young street hood chang lee help open the eye of harmony which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor with the help of female surgeon dr grace holloway doesn close it by then virtually no plot wa told the movie would ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of courtroom drama between the master and the daleks but lot of rewriting went on on the set that show how smart people are a it would have made the movie hell of lot more interesting and that would ve gotten four star rating out of me\n","in wonder boy michael douglas play an aged writer professor with such lived in naturalism that believe it may be his best performance ever since wall street douglas ha spent the greater part of his career playing variation on the shark in suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid 80 in those performance he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intention to the world you think such man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath good natured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open in wonder boy his performance isn showy or tour de force it simple yet truthful he embodies grady craggy old writer with predilection for pot and pink bathrobe grady instructs writer workshop while working tirelessly on follow up to the novel that put him on the map when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack a student bombard one of their own with unfair criticism grady point out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy their target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire student full of potential and one whom grady develops mild affection for leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotion he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just hint of dry wit around the edge he portentous and gloomy a if modeling himself after the great depressed writer though his act is little too calculated he reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog whenever happen to catch jarmusch in an interview see the man speaking in toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white leer is similar guy who equates quirk with depth tobey maguire fit well in the role with his round sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude but unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to he a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility katie holmes play hannah beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in grady pant this is plot line had trouble with douglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer man who ha actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasion at first found it extremely difficult to believe that someone a beautiful a hannah would desire grady maybe it because m jealous and wish holmes wa throwing herself at me after all may just be lowly internet critic but at least still have all my teeth then think of douglas real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones seeing those two together look lot like kidnapping suddenly my mind ha shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas there is movie in there somewhere grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charm of hannah for sara gaskell droll france mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor okay maybe not so chivalrous there is great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he say she wa junkie for the printed word lucky for me manufactured her drug of choice robert downy r play bisexual editor who make his entrance with towering transvestite on his arm downy ha mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many hipster intellectual he arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance the actor is perfectly cast here and remains joyous movie presence somewhere between typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor wish wonder boy had more of him searching for plot among the element of wonder boy would be pointless for it meander through it running time but that part of it charm and maybe m bit biased towards the film because it take place in haven of literary academia place m greatly fond of and place rarely explored in american cinema everyone ha sub genre be it war film western dance movie that they happen to be privy to m privy to film about literary type e those individual enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half notch the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to european film with it leisurely pace and situation that grow from the character rather than generic mapped out story point sometimes the dialogue is too clever but that a problem wish found with film more often another minor quibble is that early on the film seems bit too introverted like it character but a the story progress it begin to open up for me wonder boy work a subtle drama because of it insight into artistic type and a low key comedy for it chuckle worthy throwaway gag the gag are like those in the great robert altman a h the long goodbye movie where joke exist a aside on the fringe like joke in life often do the broader comedy such a the killing of blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isn ineffective but not nearly a memorable a the little thing curtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rock the cradle ha graduated to more meaningful film he directs wonder boy in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his character put up the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in wonder boy party it fit the film is like piece of literature put up on the big screen it the cinematic equivalent to good read novelistic in it approach with theme rarely found in american movie many will find it slight but found much to savor among it subtlety\n","i really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone sure she is one of the most beautiful creature on god green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it come to choosing what movie she star in she always strike out the crush wa slow moving predictable piece of fluff hideaway wa horrific novel adaptation alicia had only minor role in clueless wa an annoying unfunny waste of time and people have mailed me too saying clueless is good movie and that m the only one who doesn like it one girl said if d seen the movie with an open mind would have enjoyed it nothing could be further from the truth went into the theater expecting to love the movie the preview looked good and of course m crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie wa bunch of bad joke coming from whiny unlikable character almost everyone saw the movie with felt the same way when we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasn me yelled out that wa the worst in movie ve ever seen and the rest of u had to laugh in agreement so last night walked into the video store and saw alicia pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway what got wa 90 minute of regret the worst alicia silverstone movie ever and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like where to begin in criticizing this movie the plot is thin shred that move slower than glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it wa by ten year old alicia is the star and she still wasted in movie that ha no appeal whatsoever there is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minute when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with violent sequence zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equal zero so why doe this movie get one star out of me well alicia spends twenty minute of the movie in the bathtub and if it wasn bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the rank of our other four star feature but you settle for what you can get alicia play babysitter who spending friday night looking after two kid whose parent are out getting drunk at cocktail party and of course anyone a beautiful a alicia automatically spends their friday night at home at least that movie critic at large guy doe a the movie trods along we discover she not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character fantasy and probably every male viewer too the drunken father think she just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend let his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy look in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she taking her bubble bath they even throw in the middle aged wife fantasy about male counterpart at the party not that any of u asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200 pound woman in black silk teddy at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated in fact could imagine the babysitter becoming cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there absolutely no nudity in it so you can call it sex flick ve already pointed out that it can fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter a bad\n","plot young man who love heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon to whom he devoted tribute band in which he sings get launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place critique m sucker for movie like this young man with humble background and lofty dream work hard devotes the time the energy and the patience and ultimately hit it big time in the case of this film our boy love certain heavy metal band and a luck would have it yup luck always find it way into these type of equation although generally tied very closely to hard work they need new singer his entry and adaptation to the whole rock roll lifestyle fill the rest of the film and is really fun to watch although will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love or past love of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it metal wa one of my first love a teen and even though the genre of music isn that prominent anymore still check out my motley crue twisted sister and anthrax cd every now and again that not to say that you won like this film if you don like the music but the music and live performance from the band play big part in the movie and for one had blast watching and listening to it all but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg wow hand this fella some major prop a he totally becomes this heavy metal geek god incidentally metal god wa the film original title and much better one if you ask me he is this movie and wa quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through he came off like regular guy with extremely passionate goal and work ethic who wa willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dream aniston wa also surprisingly good a the girlfriend and the romance angle between them wa sweet but she didn pull me in hard enough during their emotional scene wa also impressed by some of the real musician who played in the film zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne jeff pilson from dokken stephan jenkins from third eye blind blas elia from slaughter but actor dominic west a kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band member it to note that this film wa based on real life tale of young man who used to sing in juda priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer their original singer also admitted to being gay a in this film just for the record m certainly not recommending this film for it originality or surprise element since most of this stuff ha already been covered in some way or another in other movie but because it a fun uplifting well paced movie with solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performance oh yeah and for those who dig the heavier side of music the soundtrack also rock you see dream can come true where joblo coming from almost famous 8 10 blow 8 10 boogie night 9 10 detroit rock city 8 10 girlfight 6 10 goodfellas 10 10\n","jaw is rare film that grab your attention before it show you

summer of 1975 taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it wa unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by star war even today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock psycho and it never seems to age although grand new technology exists that make the technical sequence including several mechanical shark obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill the technical limitation faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic element like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effect scheider dreyfus and shaw were known actor at the time jaw wa made but none of them had the draw of robert redford or paul newman nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful career because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark scheider hit just the right note a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what right and going against the entire town it your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfus who had previously been seen in american graffiti 1973 and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz 1974 give surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kid and teenager however most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw a the movie captain ahab performance sorely overlooked by the academy award bordering of parody shaw play quint a grizzled old loner whose machismo border on masochism he slightly deranged and shaw performance is almost caricature however there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scar quint is drawn into telling the story of his experience aboard the s indianapolis navy ship in world war ii that wa sunk by the japanese his tale of floating in the water for more than week with over 1 000 other men while swarm of shark slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film of course we can leave out the shark itself with it black eye endless row of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankind fear about what is unknown and threatening in nature shark is such perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaur great white do exist they can be a large a the shark in jaw and they are threat every one of spielberg subjective underwater shot make u feel queasy because let u see how we look to the shark bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected leg just ready to be chomped into the shark in jaw wa actually combination of actual footage and five different mechanical shark all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angle many have forgotten but jaw wa sort of precursor to waterworld 1995 movie who soggy production and cost overrun had universal studio worried about bomb but a we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacle and delivered one of the finest primal scare thriller ever to come out of hollywood\n","the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchable is an excellent movie because it look deeper into an already examined rivalry based on the 1959 television show of the same title the untouchable may be an exaggeration of the real life event that took place but it fit together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequence some excellent acting memorable score and clever script the film take place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobster led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public elliot ness and small force of men known a the untouchable attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order however a ness soon learns in order to stabilize peace you have to bend few law the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scene the film begin with capone played perfectly by deniro declaring that he is not violent man and he is firm believer in following all law the film then quickly transfer to the next scene in which one of capone men bomb restaurant that contains many innocent people including little girl from this point we know capone is evil not only because he kill without hesitation but also because he is lying bastard right from the first five minute of the film de palma ha created hatred towards capone and he show that this man must be brought down at all cost this developed hatred is before the film hero ness is even introduced found this approach to be very clever because in small duration of time there is great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone the film only get better from this point with the formation of the untouchable there is group of men wearing long dark overcoat and hat they walk in unison and they only look forward a they walk down the street they are observed and feared by citizen holding shot gun and pistol in their hand to stop criminal this image of vigilante must have influenced future film one that come to mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world wearing more futuristic outfit of the same 1930 style the similarity between these two are countless the untouchable ha some of the hippest bravest hero in any action film the four member were the only one willing to go against capone army each member of this special group also had their own characteristic that separated them from others elliot ness played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner is character that surely grows during the course of the film he begin a man who is determined to follow all law no matter how unfair they may be however a the film develops so doe ness his belief involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually member of the other side he also begin to lose his stability when his adversary begin to murder his friend his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in sean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role play malone an aging cop who decides to make one final run a member of the untouchable malone act a mentor to ness he teach him the chicago way to do thing when they attack with knife you attack with gun connery play his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed andy garcia doe wonderful job a george stone young man who is just becoming police officer a ness grows he begin to teach stone some valuable lesson that malone once taught him charles martin smith is also fantastic a the final member who attempt to use an income tax offense against capone smith is perfect for his role a he add some valuable comic relief to the film the action scene are also some of the most beautifully choreographed have ever seen also very similar to the matrix they are exciting and intense from western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station step the scene are well thought out and well executed the score during these scene ingeniously add to the excitement it pounding drum beat act a rhythm for the actor the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective although the real life untouchable may have been excessively glorified this film is pure entertainment and contains unique blend of great acting great directing and great action some scene capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for year and seeing them again will only make them more vivid\n","you ve got mail work alot better than it deserves to in order to make the film success all they had to do wa cast two extremely popular and attractive star have them share the screen for about two hour and then collect the profit no real acting wa involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it body it basically complete re shoot of the shop around the corner only adding few modern twist essentially it go against and defies all concept of good contemporary filmmaking it overly sentimental and at time terribly mushy not to mention very manipulative but oh how enjoyable that manipulation is but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that make the movie work a well a it doe because absolutely hated the previous ryan hank teaming sleepless in seattle it couldn have been the directing because both film were helmed by the same woman haven quite yet figured out what liked so much about you ve got mail but then again is that really important if you like something so much why even question it again the storyline is a cliched a they come tom hank play joe fox the insanely likeable owner of discount book chain and meg ryan play kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of family run child book shop called in nice homage the shop around the corner fox and kelley soon become bitter rival because the new fox book store is opening up right across the block from the small business little do they know they are already in love with each other over the internet only neither party know the other person true identity the rest of the story isn important because all it doe is serve a mere backdrop for the two star to share the screen sure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship all of this of course lead up to the predictable climax but a foreseeable a the ending is it so damn cute and well done that doubt any movie in the entire year contains scene the evokes a much pure joy a this part doe when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love wa filled with such for lack of better word happiness that for the first time all year actually left the theater smiling\n","if there one thing in common about all of hollywood major studio it that their production are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiary which specialize in independant or controversial motion picture fox searchlight and fine line respectively it obvious there no significant movement underway to promote inventive idea at the theater so when movie like gary ross pleasantville come along wrapped in blanket of innovative idea and served up on platter of fine production it a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for no thought movie quite the opposite is true in fact a director ross skillfully brings narrative with intense and intelligent undertone to the screen the story both about the joy of living life to the fullest a well a the social ill of segregation capture the essence of statement making in the cinema not in recent memory ha movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audience fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still testament that his picture wa considered worthy enough kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it star tobey maguire and reese witherspoon a two ninety teenager who through quite bit of luck find themselves zapped into fifty sitcom named pleasantville maguire a the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudo world but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the father know best time it not long before she set the town of pleasantville on end and begin to teach the townspeople in quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hue of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is soda shop owner turned painter named mr johnson jeff daniel and at the other end is close minded mayor t walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two side are simply front for clash of idea that soon involves the entire town fine performance are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective a the lead but the true complement go out to jeff daniel and t walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniel brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drip of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman envy for daniel it his most commendable performance of the last three year or more and for walsh it a complementary exclamation point on fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast work well together from start to finish there not much to dislike about pleasantville and it dynamic nature make it the perfect movie for those who want serious a well a those who don\n","a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july from ace ventura to truman burbank jim carrey ha run the whole gamut of comic yet sympathetic character 1996 the cable guy wa supposed to be his big breakthrough role from zany humor into darker more dramatic acting a most everyone know the result were well le than stellar not only did the film not do so hot at the box office but it wa also panned by critic a far a know gene siskel and are the only one willing to admit that we dug it the first time saw the cable guy in theatre wa in super critic mode and didn really like it however due to the fact that hbo show the movie every single day ve had time to lean back relax and take in the film and to my surprise it grew on me the plot is rather simple broderick play guy named steven who befriends his cable guy played by carrey then is stalked by him when steven try to break off the relationship see steven been having some problem with his girlfriend robin leslie mann and he doesn think he ha any more room in his life for new friend also some of the cable guy antic have been creeping him out carrey a the cable guy give steven various alias which later we find out are all tv character larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc he apparently life in his cable van and while many critic didn enjoy this newer darker le manic performance from carrey thought it wa interesting and rather well done for me it not the movie a whole that enjoyable but rather several individual scene karaoke jam at steven apartment medieval fight at theme restaurant and bathroom beating la liar liar just to name few perhaps the fact that more of carrey humorous side come out during these scene is what make them so funny and if you really want to see something you ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane somebody to love sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam the cable guy ha it bad spot like most any movie didn particularly like steven girlfriend and felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend also the ending while having you fooled for moment is rather contrived and somewhat dissapointing still found the cable guy to be worthwhile venture if you re at the video store and can think of anything to rent suggest you try it out or if you have hbo just wait till it come on you won have to wait long hell that what do every day\n","a movie like mortal kombat annihilation work and must be reviewed on multiple level first there the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie but occasionaly almost a if making an ironic self depreciating remark the movie toss in clearly marxist imagery no no just kidding had you going there for moment didn i in all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoint that of movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of fan of the first movie and or fan of the game the first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with martial art tournament that would decide the fate of earth and it 5 billion inhabitant the mortal won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth unfortunately shao khan wa poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet a our hero assumed fighting stance the first movie wa extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fan of the game d even go so far a to say that many folk who didn know about the game probably enjoyed the movie the writer and director knew the limitation of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didn try to overachieve there were lot of really cool fight scene with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately non intrusive bit of fluff passing itself off a plot and a we know the movie wa smashing success at the box office mortal kombat annihilation pick up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie shao khan ha decided that he going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortal winning the tournament thereafter follows approximately 85 minute of film that alternate between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid one get the general impression that the producer of the movie thought hey that last movie wa such success that we can get more money and make real movie now too bad they didn simply stick with the formula from the first movie could write volume about the thing that are wrong with this picture but here are the high point the acting is truly bad sandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scene where she try to convince u that she loved johnny cage character from the first movie who get greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst piece of mi casting think ve ever seen james remar play raiden the god of thunder in the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character a though he wa in on the joke french actor playing japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystic generally like it when actor are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast a the president of the s in the fifth element for example and remar ha always been one of my favorite utility actor but he so totally wrong for this part that he doesn even have the luxury of amused self awareness there are too many character that are introduced a being potentially important but then never seen again there are number of completely meaningless story sidetrack including muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seek out nightwolf litefoot ha mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva for these reason and many others can only give the movie 2 unless you re huge fan of the game and or the first movie in that case the following critique also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing a fighter wilson looked like she wa simply mimicing some movement taught to her by the fight choreographer hess look like she actually know some martial art and put together much more believable fight scene in the fight each of the character doe at least one thing they do in the game and often more sonya doe her kiss of death jax doe his earthquake liu kang doe his animality and so on big bonus for those of u who were looking for similar move in the first movie and found them only rarely there aren a many fight scene in this movie a there were in the first because the folk making the movie mistakenly try to hang more robust plot in between silly silly folk and the lamest fight involved two of the woman in what turn into mud wrestling match lame and so obviously sexist even politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effect are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animality motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro wa in the first movie for folk like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the game give this 5 you ll probably like it but not nearly a much a you liked the first one\n","that exactly how long the movie felt to me there weren even nine laugh in nine month it a terrible mess of movie starring terrible mess of man mr hugh grant huge dork it not the whole oral sex prostitution thing referring to grant not me that bug me it the fact that grant is annoying not just adam sandler annoying we re talking jim carrey annoying since when do eye flutter and nervous smile pas for acting but on the other hand since when do really bad slapstick fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant head in joan cusack lap scene he paid 60 to have included in the movie and obscene double entendres robin williams the obstetrician tell grant pregnant girlfriend she ha big pussy referring of course to the size of the cat hair on her coat but nonetheless grant paid 60 to have the exchange included in the movie pas for comedy nine month is predictable cookie cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot hugh grant play successful child psychiatrist why child psychologist so the scriptwriter could inject the following unfunny exchange kid my dad an asshole grant flutter eyelash offer nervous smile then responds in his annoying english accent and think actually have talent attitude could you possibly elaborate on that kid my dad a _huge_ asshole more like hugh asshole but that beside the point which is nine month includes too many needlessly stupid joke that get laugh from the ten year old in the audience while everyone else shake his or her head in disbelief so anyway grant find out his girlfriend is pregnant and doe his usual reaction fluttered eyelash nervous smile this pave the way for every possible pregnancy child birth gag in the book especially since grant equally annoying friend wife is also pregnant the annoying friend is played by tom arnold who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick none of which is funny such a scene where arnold beat up costumed arnie the dinosaur you draw your own parallel on that one in toy store the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway a an artist with fear of and simultaneous longing for commitment not even robin williams who play russian doctor who ha recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics ha much humor his is one joke character the old foreign guy who mispronounces english stereotype did someone say yakov smirnov that my favorite vodka by the way hence the line now it time to take look at your volvo another nasty but unamusing joke except this one go right over the ten year old head while the adult simultaneously groan nine month is complete failure low on laugh and intelligence and high on loud unfunny slapstick failed joke and other uninspired lunacy hugh grant sunset boulevard arrest please no caught with his pant down joke may bring more people into the theater but they certainly won leave with smile on their face not after 90 minute of grant nervous smile everything in the movie is so forced so unauthentic that anyone with an q over 80 sorry hugh will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire but at least they didn spend 60 buck for it\n","play it to the bone the newest addition to ron shelton sport themed repertoire fails in numerous way like most of shelton other great film bull durham white men can jump this dud unsuccessfully attempt to use athleticism a method of connecting character and creating interesting subplots shelton film are not considered sport film but they do heavily revolve around specific game to tell story shelton ha been so good in the past at using sport to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of film we are given an examination of different class and race living in various different region play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull but the side story of the two guy and girl travelling across the country is even worse the film ha no social message like it predecessor the relationship between the friend two failed boxer who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollar is very confusing for number of reason the whole film since it is primarily buddy picture depends on the strength of the friendship the two character have for each other unfortunately it is very weak bond for the reason listed below 1 we never see how cesar antonio banderas and vince woody harrelson meet the two are so different from each other that scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory 2 vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to la vega there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the character laugh together or actually agree on something 3 the third character on the trip grace lolita davidovich stand in the way she is in nearly every scene with them making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male character are going to have when they fight each other 4 there are two many interfering irrelevant side story vince is convinced that he see jesus on regular basis cesar yell at the sky in spanish when he is angry and grace try to sell her invention to hotel owner robert wagner these boring tale only hurt the central plot 5 when it come to time for the two men to fight they don even hesitate to pound each other wasn the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friend who could never hurt each other by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with the film want to be over shelton on the other hand continues to tell his story forty five painful minute remain the boxing scene between cesar and vince start out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movie however the fight go on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile kind of like the whole film\n","knock off is exactly that cheap knock off of an action movie it also the worst movie have seen thus far this year figured it would be at least couple of month before saw the worst film of 1998 but ala it ha already been found jean claude van damme star a think designer jean executive who discovers his half brother ha been supplying him with cheaper good rob schneider play van damme partner and rochon play actually have no idea who rochon wa supposed to be she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation a to why she wa there many thing are not explained in this film but do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing jackie chan impression throughout the flick where chan come off a endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his film van damme just come off a wimp we re never given any clear explanation a to the basis for many of his action to be more clear did not even know who he wa supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it wa not made too clear the film ha been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong tsui hark who directed van damme last movie the bad but not nearly a bad a this double team never let the camera rest for second and that no exaggeration we are even treated to five second shot from the point of view of van damme foot entering shoe fabulous seriously though have no problem with director who want to play around with film convention a long a they don get carried away for example look at sam raimi army of darkness one of his best movie feature some of the most inventive camera work have ever seen but raimi never let the special effect get in the way of story that a concept that tsui can seem to grasp the special effect and outrageous camera angle rule knock off to the point where the audience doesn have clue a to what happening any more another problem with the film is that it look cheap the film stock used is of such low caliber that thought wa watching one of those chinese film shown really late at night and for some inexplicable reason everyone voice seems to have been dubbed even the star and even the special effect seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent for example there is scene in which van damme drive car out of window the car slam into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed second later the car drive off at full speed hey have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but line must be drawn somewhere finally the acting nobody give good performance in this film van damme an actor usually like is way off the mark playing everyman and schneider here to provide comic relief assume is totally unfunny and over act his way through every scene even the usually solid paul sorvino give terribly over the top performance a once again have no idea who he wa supposed to be in case haven yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van damme career and possibly the worst movie of the decade and it not even one of those movie that so bad it funny it too inept to be funny there are no redeeming factor in knock off and seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased\n","forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects set in 1692 at salem massachusetts the crucible open with group of teenage girl passionately singing and dancing around boiling cauldron in the middle of forest under the glow of full moon

day lewis abigail winona ryder suddenly seizes chicken beat it against the ground and smear her face and lip with the fresh blood taking even adolescent hormone surge into account surely this chicken bashing bit is bit excessive especially for prim puritan sensibility surely to the puritan eye this is a close to coven of witch a it get the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play this is far from harmless event bad start to an already shaky morality tale the play describes the film opening scene during tense exchange that make one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply and this add to the play charged atmosphere in the film the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora box not only is credulity stretched but abigail obsession is unfortunately spotlighted it position the crucible more a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent woman than against witch hunt it will bring back the memory of rabbit boiling away in pot not surprisingly the nighttime forest frenzy doe not go unnoticed and when two girl fail to wake the following morning witch are invoked by those eager to blame when the girl are questioned their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witness led lustfully by abigail with alarming synchronicity our hormonally advantaged girl zealously gesture and point accusing finger at innocent constant reminder that abigail passion set all this into inexorable motion abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor love his wife elizabeth joan allen by including her among those accused of witchcraft appropriately narrow waisted and equipped with distractingly white smile watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to murky yellow day lewis play the dashing moral hero with an over earnestness that longs to be watched director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foaming mouth fervour with shot where we stare up at proctor a if he wa mounted on pedestal for our admiration otherwise hytner direction is unremarkable ryder performance a abigail is a consistent a her mood swing her fit of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moment are le successful abigail supposedly revel in her newfound power but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here paul scofield is fine a the overzealous judge danforth but the incessant moral posturing of all the character along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girl prick at the nerve probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing allen elizabeth come out a the most sympathetic character scene near the end featuring private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequence are revealed unfortunately when john audience again increase to more than one his urge to pontificate return and the human urgency of his situation is lost it is clear that miller meant well but do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversion his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distraction coming out a loud a the message the result is clumsy muddle felt like the chicken from the opening scene head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy handed to be wholly believable when the gallows beckoned it wa sweet release indeed far from bewitching the crucible test the patience\n","i wish could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of sport film bet it wa some hotshot warner brother agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernail saying it would be very light comedic version of any given sunday and we could throw in the hoosier angle with the casting of gene hackman a the tough but determined coach throw in that hunk of guy keanu reef and cast of wacky character and poof we ll have hit on our hand the replacement is hokey mistake of football film mishmash collage of one dimensional character rampant stereotype of culture and race cliched emotional statement of purpose and keanu reef wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography the story is loosely based around the pro football player strike in 1987 and rag tag team of replacement football player taking up the rein of professional play for variety of team with name like the washington sentinel keanu reef star a shane falco ha been football college player looking for redemption gene hackman don fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like certain coach in hoosier rounding out the cast includes swinger jon favreau 7 up pitchman orlando jones gruff owner jack warden and cast of wacky and unknown actor who do amazing job of portraying perfectly stereotyped character the drunken welshman the overweight sumo wrestler the black convict the violent cop and the dumb dumb cheerleader this bunch of nobody try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoff with unbelievable football play gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is keanu reef looking for his body double making him look good on the football field and cheerleader hired from the local strip club making the girl from coyote ugly look like waitress from denny the usual thing happen like clockwork the hero rise from the ash of failure the team come together in unity the hero fall in love with conventional love interest the football game are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audience cheer and clap and the cheerleader make you want to go home and watch late night movie on cinemax it also shame when decent director with good movie under their belt go to seed and become television and sequel hack howard deutch who wa behind the camera for two of the best film of 80 pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful ha since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episode obviously the problem is that without good script any director will fail in the end sport film are strong vehicle for cinematic glory gritty tale involving the honor of men and the valiant effort taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds the rise and fall of gallant hero and story of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life the replacement offer none of this\n","call it road trip for the walking wounded stellan skarsg rd play such convincingly zombified drunken loser that it difficult to spend nearly two hour of screen time in his smelly boozed out presence yet this ever reliable swedish actor add depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen sentimental and painfully mundane european drama playwright august strindberg built his career on family and relationship paralyzed by secret unable to express their longing until the hour is far too late that an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father tomas skarsg rd and his alienated openly hostile yuppie daughter kaisa lena headey gossip they haven spoken in year and wouldn even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen scotland by automobile if it weren for kaisa mother charlotte rampling under the sand rotting away in hospital bed from cancer in soap opera twist mother ha only few day to live only in the movie right too blitzed to even step foot on plane tomas hit the open road with kaisa loathing each other all the while they make periodic stop for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pas out whenever he isn muttering what rotten kid she turned out to be despite his sloshed viewpoint tomas recognizes that the apple hasn fallen very far from the tree kaisa get nosebleed from snorting coke sabotage her

that trivialize the father daughter conflict they re also the mainstay of many bad strindberg wannabe this revelation exists purely for it own sake aberdeen doesn know where else to go weak unimaginative casting thwart the pivotal role of kaisa if lena headey were stronger actress perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performance and moody haunting cinematography rendering norway into it own pastoral ghost world the reference to certain superior american indie flick intentional headey too busy acting using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance if she were paying any attention to skarsg rd maybe she figure out that doing le can reveal so much more it worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 jonathan nossiter captivating sign wonder it not just because skarsg rd and rampling played disturbed parental figure in both film they re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen the difference in the way their character were presented is significant in aberdeen rampling is luminous diva preening and static in her hospital bed despite skarsg rd solid performance a tomas his pathetic drunk is never given much of chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow there genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontation in sign wonder allowing them to suggest gray zone of complication that accompany torn romance and year of stifled curiosity nossiter film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism a an illusion to deflect pain if sign wonder sometimes feel overloaded with idea at least it willing to stretch beyond what we ve come to expect from traditional drama aberdeen is never half so ambitious content to sleepwalk through the rhythm and timing of other movie when did character driven story stop paying attention to the complexity of real life the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan trite but occasionally useful grand canyon where steve martin hollywood mogul pronounces all of life riddle are answered in the movie even foreign film are taking that advice to heart\n","party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedy ve seen in awhile late rip off of the meatball series the film follows group of young camp counselor at camp chipmunk that really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wise cracking jerry andrew ross ha the hots for cute blonde kerry brennan and there is big contest in the climax how fun since party camp ha practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the maker could have done wa make it raunchy and exploitative it not that think exploitation is necessarily good quality but when you are talking about dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with lot of mindless sex even psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick at least then it wouldn have been such chore to sit through never before have seen so many joke fall astoundingly flat the comedy wa easy to spot but it wasn the least bit funny it wa groan inducing constantly throghout wa asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie wa worth anything so what save party camp from the dreaded zero star rating well that simple jewel shepard a flighty bimbo wa admittedly fun to watch although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depth of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add little spice to an otherwise rancid low budget teen comedy\n","i ve noticed something lately that ve never thought of before pseudo substance hollywood faking deep meaning in their film have you ever seen movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there wa something missing more and more filmmaker seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic film that evoke strong connotation of being great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff m not trying to say city of angel is that bad it had lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered somehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there wa gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performance and glossy cinematography the predictable ending that shattered our hope even though we saw it coming only added to the disappointment but for over an hour city of angel is well worth the time nicolas cage is seth guardian angel who like hundred likely thousand or even million of other angel spends eternity watching over the citizen of mortality human never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life meg ryan in her most subdued performance yet play maggie doctor who begin to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive after losing patient on the surgery table these question envelope maggie and seth the angel who wa there to oversee the patient transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated by the doctor he begin following and observing maggie falling more and more in love with her everyday angel who we quickly learn are not and never were human can not experience human sensation such a taste and touch but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire seth adoration is too much to resist and eventually he doe appear to maggie quite regularly although such thing seems taboo among the angelic community the angel are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitman than traditional glowing white entity but it a nice touch that never seems like mere attempt at uniqueness cage is wonderfully versatile actor think face off raising arizona and it could happen to you what combo who slip into the role of heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once it nice to see ryan pick up role like this and the one in courage under fire the two aren very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy role and it an impressive side of ryan movie goer rarely have the chance to enjoy but even though the two lead do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grab u with his interpretation of hospital patient who know more than meet the eye it a shame that with so much going for it city of angel falter so much in it final stage leaving u with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie wa out there they just didn know quite how to get to it they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high filmmaker should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling u for 60 minute that this film is glorious masterpiece they sure leave u with disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouth based on the german film wing of desire that being the english title of course city of angel is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive it shortcoming even the devastatingly disappointing ending most movie goer the non cynic anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which need to be criticized nonetheless city of angel is beautifully captivating which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewer who will appreciate delve into rich emotional territory\n","quest for camelot is warner bros first feature length fully animated attempt to steal clout from disney cartoon empire but the mouse ha no reason to be worried the only other recent challenger to their throne wa last fall promising if flawed 20th century fox production anastasia but disney hercules with it lively cast and colorful palate had her beat hand down when it came time to crown 1997 best piece of animation this year it no contest a quest for camelot is pretty much dead on arrival even the magic kingdom at it most mediocre that be pocahontas for those of you keeping score isn nearly a dull a this the story revolves around the adventure of free spirited kayley voiced by jessalyn gilsig the early teen daughter of belated knight from king arthur round table kayley only dream is to follow in her father footstep and she get her chance when evil warlord ruber gary oldman an ex round table member gone bad steal arthur magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in dangerous booby trapped forest with the help of hunky blind timberland dweller garrett carey elwes and two headed dragon eric idle and don rickles that always arguing with itself kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth a fighter on arthur side quest for camelot is missing pure showmanship an essential element if it ever expected to climb to the high rank of disney there nothing here that differentiates quest from something you see on any given saturday morning cartoon subpar animation instantly forgettable song poorly integrated computerized footage compare kayley and garrett run in with the angry ogre to herc battle with the hydra rest my case even the character stink none of them are remotely interesting so much that the film becomes race to see which one can out bland the others in the end it a tie they all win that dragon comedy shtick is awfully cloying but at least it show sign of pulse at least fan of the early 90 tgif television line up will be thrilled to find jaleel urkel white and bronson balki pinchot sharing the same footage few scene are nicely realized though m at loss to recall enough to be specific and the actor providing the voice talent are enthusiastic though most are paired up with singer who don sound thing like them for their big musical moment jane seymour and celine dion but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good aside from the fact that child will probably be a bored watching this a adult quest for camelot most grievous error is it complete lack of personality and personality we learn from this mess go very long way\n","the blair witch project wa perhaps one of kind unique film that played completely on it own merit managing to scare even the most experienced horror fan out of their sens it success made sequel inevitable but this is not the sequel suspect anyone much wanted after the release of the blair witch project tourist have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville in order to get glimpse of the blair witch local have turned this mass hysteria into great business opportunity selling twig sculpture stone and dirt like those in the movie and the exasperated local sheriff patrol the wood with bullhorn shouting get out of these wood and go home there is no goddamned blair witch jeff is one of those people who ha used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage after he got released from the mental institution he created mobile business that attracts thousand of customer through the internet a the movie start he is leading one of these group into the wood on the blair witch hunt among the five stranger is stephen and his girlfriend the pregnant tristen who are writing book on the hysteria caused by the film called the blair witch history or hysteria and kim who dress in black and ha some psychic power the last member of the crew is erica young beautiful witch wannabe who constantly quote from the wiccan lore saying the first rule of wicca is do no harm because whatever you do will come back to you threefold this strange group plunge into the wood where they begin to argue about their different approach to the experience on the very first night that they decide to spend under the star amidst the ruin of parr abandoned house strange thing start happening when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tape remain after while they discover strange marking on their body they are somehow lost in time a it loop uncontrollably back and forth they are all haunted by hallucination and horrible nightmare and soon they can not see the difference between dream and reality the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the wood documentary director joe berlinger paradice lost helm blair witch 2 leaving the creator of the first film dan myrick and ed sanches in the background the opening scene the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film is more promising approach because instead of trying to cover similar ground it go outside the first film and make it own stand but soon the movie get confused and sidetracked by it own story that is never resolved and end with very anticlimaxic epilogue in way this is typical hollywood sequel more money ha been spent and more people have worked on project that wa doomed to fail the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated of course in these situation quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical value from it opening scene when the camera gracefully pane over the bloody red forest with carter burwell being john malkovich and fargo musical score in the background you realize that with the exception of it title this film ha absolutely nothing to do with the blair witch project blair witch wa filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that wa mostly based on improvisation in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection creating completely different atmosphere with it graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the film ha very polished look which is impossible to associate with the first installment and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that make the adrenaline rush through the body couple of time he ha obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor the key is simplicity blair witch project had story which wa incredibly simple that allowed the audience to fill the gap with our own imagination the film wa practically an empty screen on which we projected our most frightening nightmare the effect wa incredibly powerful lasting and entir everyone but in different way book of shadow feel incredibly controlled and restrict here very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and clever that the screenwriter are the first to get lost in it there is is no book of shadow and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with this is simply le artistic film that doesn have the talent and originality of it predecessor it resort to fancy cinematography and special effect to create the right effect and doesn always succeed but most importantly it stand on it own ground and ha almost no connection with the first movie which doesn allow it to destroy the original in the end can call it bad effort it le artistic not so scary and le original but certainly not bad it simply different in fact if you haven seen the blair witch project you might like this film for what it is cross between the blair witch project and the scream film the only element that remains constant and similar between the two film is the solid acting jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned and incredible sense of surrealism but it a common knowledge and experience that with few exception every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making to me the story of the blair witch project seemed completed but there are obviously no limit to commercial success that the book of shadow is certainly assured and it already time to look forward to blair witch 3\n","when it come to the average teenage romantic comedy expect negative review from critic left and right predictable unoriginal and forgettable will most likely be the three adjective to haunt the down to you and the drive me crazy released by the dozen these last couple of year what really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while m sitting in the theater am enjoying myself is this comfortable break from my week of final this is why have given film like final destination or road trip high mark had party of time wasting my money on something won remember next week so last week opened up the new york time and no surprise boy and girl got negative review daily news negative reelviews negative epinions com negative this wa nothing new american pie final destination road trip didn get such hot review and loved those guilty pleasure same go for she all that formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded since boy and girl reunites she all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr predicted j vu al over again but still curious asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it the reaction were far from positive had made up my mind ll catch it on video or cable in couple of year but soon after following series of unexpected event we couldn get into shaft because it is rated i found myself watching boy and girl whoop boy and girl is about nerdy smart boy named ryan prinze jr and popular flirt girl named jennifer claire forlani briefly meeting a pre teen and now attending the same college the two bump into each other so many time that eventually they become best friend but in the movie male and female cannot be friend without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other with advice from their roommate amanda detmer jason biggs ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship the film definitely life up to the dreaded three adjective and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reason the dialogue is probably the worst have ever seen in any movie mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous word these character use is what hollywood think kid can relate to it is almost offensive an example of an insightful conversation you re dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb no followed by mandy moore esque tune background well it not a bad a wing commander guess the supporting cast is also painfully useless detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring pointless subplots and although this is supposed to be from both perspective of the human sex prinze jr ryan dominates the screen while forlani jennifer simply act a dilemma for him to work with we never learn anything about jennifer which is shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character teenager or not you ll hate this movie guarantee it maybe should rent she all that again is it really a good a think it is\n","sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality he is praised for some of the most important film of the previous decade like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict but in the same time almost any of such pearl is followed by stinker that hamper lumet reputation stranger among u 1992 rip off of peter weir witness belongs to the latter category the heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes show too much enthusiasm in battling bad guy on the street of new york during one of such action her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and a result she becomes depressed in order to help her recover boss give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community emily start investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover that isn easy because her modern manner are colliding with traditionalist way thing get even more complicated when she develops feeling for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal using peter weir formula isn the greatest flaw of this film even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot work to the certain extent but the worst insult to viewer audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith the author of this review never liked this actress very much but she wa at least tolerable in some of her role role of emily eden unfortunately isn one of them first of all she can pas for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pas for orthodox jewish woman isn much better screenplay by robert avrech make thing even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots scene involving two italian gangster wa almost too painful to watch but on the other hand other actor are more convincing lee richardson a an old rabbi thal a ariel and charming mia sara a his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scene take place in hassidic community also the film might educate viewer about hassidic culture that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time\n","so ask yourself what 8mm eight millimeter is really all about is it about wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his value after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of big town americana there a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desire or is it about those who can those who are in position to influence the making of the kind of film sick and demented people want to see m not talking about snuff film supposed documentary of victim being brutalized and killed on camera m talking about film like 8mm and it director joel schumacher with recent run of big budget movie to his credit batman robin time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly ha that kind of influence is 8mm something you really want to see probably not the first two third of 8mm unwind a fairly conventional missing person drama albeit with particularly unsavory core then a it been threatening all along the film explodes into violence and just when you think it finally over schumacher tag on ridiculous self righteous finale that drag the whole unpleasant experience down even further trust me there are better way to waste two hour of your life nicolas snake eye cage play private investigator tom welles who is hired by wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether reel of film found in her late husband safe document young girl murder welles go about his assignment rather matter of factly and the piece of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost a if you don need any specialized skill or training to do this welles certainly make it look easy and cop obviously never look in toilet tank for clue the deeper welles dig into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george scott in paul schrader hardcore occasionally little flickering sound whir in his head like sprocket winding through film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task there are hint that this is taking it toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split level home in harrisburg pa 8mm doesn condemn or condone it subject matter it just exploit it the irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walker vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an rated first run hollywood product so we only see snippet of snuff and lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror later it the turn of joaquin phoenix who quite good and by far the film most interesting character a adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face a the horrid thing is screened over and over again all this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviant are not indeed monster but everyday people like you and me neither super nor standard 8mm is shocking only in it banality\n","national lampoon animal house made in 1978 and set in 1962 remains one of the no fuck that noise the funniest movie ever made and this isn just my opinion

portman the professional a queen amidala liam neeson schindler list a qui gon jinni ewan mcgregor trainspotting a obi wan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way a young anakin skywalker if you ve read any review you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy you also may have heard that this one too kiddie friendly and doesn have enough content for adult believe the hype the effect are stunning the digitalized creature are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duel are amazing and queen amidala sumptuous robe are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth but there something missing here and it isn budget or effect it everything money can buy the actor struggle a best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat character the most successful at this is liam neeson who a qui gon jinni jedi master to young obi wan kenobi ha quiet dignity and wise commanding presence he is the anchor to this movie a he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out portman queen amidala and mcgregor obi wan kenobi don fare nearly so well amidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation come off a stoic stilted and caricatured it appears a though she wa vulcan geisha in former life and obi wan although mcgregor make him very endearing ha so little screen time that he nothing but robin to qui gon jinni batman however mcgregor doe struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with spark of genuine insight and humanity and he doe good job he also absolutely nail alec guiness obi wan in episode 4 6 scottish accent and that really make his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise in fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite bit and that one of the problem with this film would never call myself star war fan especially not considering what it mean to be fanatic these day but ve always enjoyed the film along with everyone else in america however if you are the one person in america who hasn seen the film at all or even recently or who doesn bother to brush up on the name of obscure character you may be hopelessly lost for example one of the film main nefarious character is senator palpatine for those of you not recently steeped in star war trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who wa darth vader master in return of the jedi and empire strike back so obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echo of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful lot of the movie is like that r2 d2 and 3po make token appearance and it obvious that lucas is banking on the audience pre existing fondness for them because he doesn do much to add to it in any way same go for jabba the hutt who doesn look a much mean here a he doe corpulent and lazy even planet make foreshadowing guest appearance in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strike back and alderaan leia home planet which we never actually see that get blown up in star war show up or are mentioned briefly in passing what the result of tying so many plot point and character to future film the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty there no meat no substance that make you want to love the character a they are not a they will be another problem is that there are actually too many alien character in the film wa distracted by the fact that two of the main evil character strange looking alien who looked like gila monster had mouth that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual character and jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended a comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast unlike chewbacca and 3po who got their humanity if you ll pardon the expression from their interaction with the human character jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at time making the movie seem like nothing more than very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtle furthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some character into nothing more than bystander to the plot oddly this isn just my judgment lucas ha said that he designed this film for kid well he done good job the hero of this film of course is young anakin but it wa very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy that not jake lloyd fault though he doe good job of being cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him that another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader warning spoiler ahead in my opinion there wa not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin future evil in the film the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheek and there nothing more than spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie he ha doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is slave to gross flying gnome on tatooine but the only indication the audience get that this kid isn all heart and rose is yoda hesitation in allowing him to train a jedi under qui gon jinni his explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead enter at your own risk of course the noble qui gon dy at the hand of darth maul scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi art but ha turned to the dark side this dude ha maybe two line in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing move with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup because qui gon never get chance to train the young anakin in the way of the force obi wan qui gon young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself so at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begin with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker did this story need to be told would say no but is it worthwhile movie to see absolutely if you don enter the theater with jedi size expectation and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie the tatooine pod race are triumph of effect and computer animation the digitalized background on some of the planet are an astonishing sight and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origin in simpler happier time above all this is fun movie not deep not meaningful and not profound but fun maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct because if lucas doe the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it need the most potential\n","seen may 31 1999 on home video rented one of the best thing about the movie is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze thing in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise with some film it might be just secondary issue but with dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in movie there an old role playing computer game called ja wherein the player take on the role of man who can remember who he is where he is and how he got there the goal is to gather a many clue a possible to figure that out and along the way overcome conflict the premise to this film is not unlike that game only this time we don have control over the protagonist we begin by meeting seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually it more than just the city it the whole reality that isn just that neo gothic look la batman blade runner but is so fully developed it almost different genre completely later he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he ha no idea what going on other than the fact something is not right the fact there a dead body in the corner go to enhance the feeling of paranoia and mysterious hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling this opening scene alone go long way to define the setting of the film and it bizarre horrific tone the man doesn know who he is nor where he going and it interesting to follow him since we the viewer have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him in fact this is the way all story begin since it impossible to know the history of character their feeling value moral etc until after we ve observed them for while but in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story eventually some semblance of plot begin to unfold a it appears that john is serial killer wanted by the police we met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time two other important character are also introduced dr daniel schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist who claim to be john doctor and emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled up to look like caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serial or any given leading lady of the old film noir movie it wa schreber who contacted john for reason that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film he also contact emma which further help the film reveal what is seemingly complex mysterious back story but absolutely nothing is a it appears to be in dark city which is what make it so fascinating throughout it continual scene of confusion and vertigo everything the filmmaker want u to see ha some significance considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot it lighting art direction and overall production design they don seem to be able to afford any gratuity however that might also be what keeping it from reaching it maximum potential by continuing to follow john a he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come to realize that it all hoax everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by race of alien to understand what make human tick in their effort to somehow save themselves from extinction but a the film tagline say last night one of u went off for reason that are never clearly explained it appears that john posse telekinetic power to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive process known a tuning the alien which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also posse the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight at the same time all the human fall asleep and after the change are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin new life they have no idea they did not have until then this premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard he doe provide some explanation such a that dr schreber is an assistant to the stranger because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form the alien mix and match the memory of the city population to see who will change and who will not in the process this creates for good deal of deep thought provoking philosophy that could be applied to the real world however where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart a to what make person who he or she is the main character are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotion it come off a distant static and cold mediocre performance by hurt and connelly don help either for example john realizes emma is not and probably never wa his wife so he doe not feel an emotional bond to her yet in some scene crucial to the film plot we are expected to believe they do have genuine love for each other which is also part of the film climax and ending and that what proyas seems to be inferring with the film but never quite manages to convey in it fullest sense ironically this is what made his first film the crow work so well which had similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world with dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message still the film is by no mean bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable there a lot to like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which account for at least half the reason the film is able to tell the story it doe the story a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in year dark city is what the movie are all about the escape from the real world\n","the american action film ha been slowly drowning to death in sea of asian wire fu copycat

abstract some people simply call it trash life le ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feeling definitely generation aimed movie life le ordinary ha everything from claymation to profane angel to karaoke based musical dream sequence whew anyone in their 30 or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film it somewhat silly it somewhat outrageous and it definitely not your typical romance story but for the right audience it work lot of hype ha been surrounding this film due to the fact that it come to u from the same team that brought u trainspotting well sorry folk but haven seen trainspotting so can really compare whether that work in this film favor or not is beyond me but do know this ewan mcgregor whom had never had the pleasure of watching definitely charmed me he wa great cameron diaz character wa uneven and bit hard to grasp the audience may find it difficult to care about her thus discouraging the hope of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him misguided you bet loveable you bet life le ordinary wa delight and even had bonus for me when realized it wa filmed in my hometown of salt lake city utah this wa just one more thing didn know about this movie when sat down with five dollar order of nacho and three dollar coke maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for pleasant surprise but think even if had known would have been just a happy life le ordinary is quirky eccentric and downright charming not for everyone but definite change of pace for your typical

geared toward kid casper or the arthouse crowd ghost world but there never really been comic book like from hell before for starter it wa created by alan moore and eddie campbell who brought the medium to whole new level in the mid 80 with 12 part series called the watchman to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look little odd the book or graphic novel if you will is over 500 page long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnote in other word don dismiss this film because of it source if you can get past the whole comic book thing you might find another stumbling block in from hell director albert and allen hughes getting the hughes brother to direct this seems almost a ludicrous a casting carrot top in well anything but riddle me this who better to direct film that set in the ghetto and feature really violent street crime than the mad genius behind menace ii society the ghetto in question is of course whitechapel in 1888 london east end it a filthy sooty place where the whore called unfortunate are starting to get little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who ha been carving through their profession with surgical precision when the first stiff turn up copper peter godley robbie coltrane the world is not enough call in inspector frederick abberline johnny depp blow to crack the case abberline widower ha prophetic dream he unsuccessfully try to quell with copious amount of absinthe and opium upon arriving in whitechapel he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly heather graham say it isn so and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crime that even the police surgeon can stomach don think anyone need to be briefed on jack the ripper so won go into the particular here other than to say moore and campbell have unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reason he chooses to slay in the comic they don bother cloaking the identity of the ripper but screenwriter terry hayes vertical limit and rafael yglesias le mi rables do good job of keeping him hidden from viewer until the very end it funny to watch the local blindly point the finger of blame at jew and indian because after all an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly act and from hell ending had me whistling the stonecutter song from the simpson for day who hold back the electric car who made steve guttenberg star don worry it ll all make sense when you see it now onto from hell appearance it certainly dark and bleak enough and it surprising to see how much more it look like tim burton film than planet of the ape did at time it seems like sleepy hollow 2 the print saw wasn completely finished both color and music had not been finalized so no comment about marilyn manson but cinematographer peter deming don say word ably capture the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scene remind me of the crazy flashback in twin peak even though the violence in the film pale in comparison to that in the black and white comic oscar winner martin child shakespeare in love production design turn the original prague surroundings into one creepy place even the acting in from hell is solid with the dreamy depp turning in typically strong performance and deftly handling british accent ians holm joe gould secret and richardson 102 dalmatian log in great supporting role but the big surprise here is graham cringed the first time she opened her mouth imagining her attempt at an irish accent but it actually wasn half bad the film however is all good 2 00 for strong violence gore sexuality language and drug content\n","reindeer game is easily the worst of the three recent film penned by ehren kruger scream 3 and arlington rd are the others each derivative in their own special way the guy can seem to write believable dialogue sample from reindeer game rule 1 never put car thief behind the wheel create multi faceted character or even engineer coherent plot but he sure know how to pile on numerous nonsensical twist and turn no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely his screenplay for reindeer game turn the table on the audience so many time that watching the film becomes something of punishment with no reward anywhere in sight can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie wa gonna go here ck you jack as take that twist decipher this mother cker it almost a if the writer were angry at u for shelling out money to see his stupid movie and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in movie when the screenwriter keep changing his own rule for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is auteur theory be damned it kruger style not the director that wind up on screen kruger ha obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut sometimes le is more and his numerous twist can even claim to be original arlington rd ending is direct steal from the much better alan pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer game we get this ol gem character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn know pronoun used to protect the gender of the character grammar be damned how did you know that the stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character wa in on the whole thing all along since twist ending are currently so in vogue and seeing a how kruger screenplay usually come equipped with about three twist per ending guess it no wonder why he work so frequently he quickly becoming miramax mickey mouse the company ha already signed him to work on several of their upcoming project this is appropriate considering that miramax which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring film ha quickly become grindhouse for coddling foreign import life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicle their company current logo could be we ride the trend reindeer game star ben affleck a rudy supposedly hardened criminal spending his day and night behind bar with fantasy of pecan pie dancing atop his head although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoo to insinuate bad assness he play the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through police academy flick affleck is such puppy dog that it impossible to believe he could survive in harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone bitch the role itself is so badly written the character only grows ball when the plot call for it the twist so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about a close to self parody a can recall recent serious movie getting it may have been wiser had the film maker simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld a the hardened criminal and howard stern a the sniveling bad guy who played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance james frain is nick rudy cellmate manslaughterer who found pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron ashley is prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photo of her though she never seen one picture of him which work out fine since the character is killed in near riot and rudy who wa to be paroled on the same day a nick take his place which lead to sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda look like rape and surprise visit from ashley brother gabriel gary sinise who waltz into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co horts he plan to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he think is nick who according to what he wrote in the letter to ashley used to work a guard in the indian casino though by the end the film pull the rug out from under u so frequently that everything ve described might a well be irrelevant this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on several scene in which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy ha chance to kill his captor and crack stupid one liner included two 2 scene of two 2 different bad guy explaining their motif to the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no le though it an action film the ending is more talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to u by one flustered character actor after another while affleck look on incredulous a the audience the flick wa directed by john frankenheimer straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the list following string of flop and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up it would be success story if he were choosing better script but his last major film wa ronin one of those almost but not quite movie which followed the island of dr morneau you remember the one with marlon brando in mime make up and not so flattering moo moo and now this he film action sequence with minimum of quick cutting which like considering that nowadays action scene are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cut strung together and laid out for brain zapped mtv audience to pick apart problem is these action scene nearly all failed escape serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than filmed radio play character problem abound rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of which is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off the former he can do with ease and often the actor coast on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear but then suddenly affleck start growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating tarantino gangster charlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her to play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next she never ha chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attribute frankenheimer ha her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this gary sinise ha played this role frequently and here a in snake eye he doe the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same pace that going out of control is the only thing that keep him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he go again than threat these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to script with little but stock character and bag of trick that it dully spring on it

obvious ending worth getting to here there nothing just teen whining about who going to take them to the big dance do me favor kid go get job or something just shut the hell up in all honesty the best part of this film is the end credit now normally when say that it followed with the joke because the movie is finally over in this case though the end credit really are the most entertaining part of

1991 award winning documentary lumumba death of prophet virtually guaranteeing that his new fictional account of patriot remains true to it subject peck with co writer pascal bonitzer begin at the end

of nation struggling for independence from the sometimes odious colonialist who have ruled much of the world from their european seat of power for century peck focus his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba his friend and foe and the independence movement that gripped africa in the 50 and 60 during the time the story take place many new nation including nigeria and somalia were born with varying degree of success and failure usually dependent upon which country colonized them some colonial master were better than others the effort involved in lumumba is quite ambitious a peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decade if at all production value are first rate on what must be small by u standard budget the period feel and realistic african setting are nicely maintained in production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique the screenplay cover lot of ground and doe yeoman work in providing great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba life the political side of thing is evenly told in linear straightforward manner that teach not preaches it concentrate on the good deed of the man if bit a stalwart saint but doesn embellish on larger than life persona the family side of patrice life is handled in several perfunctory and brief interlude that show him talking to one of his child embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child know the intent is to flesh the man out but too

political film that didn do whole lot for me wag the dog for instance found to be an intelligent but heartless film while primary color is unbearable and unwatchable in it awfulness bulworth is far better film than these both in it execution and lasting impression it a tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it also ha an emotional center writer director star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character and in turn we like him and actually care about the story beatty play incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth the film open and we see bulworth sobbing a he watch his television spot over and over again he hasn slept in day nor ha he eaten and almost instantaneously he go insane he not stark raving mad not outright anyway but he definitely bonkers it the final weekend of his campaign and his assistant murphy oliver platt ha written him speech to feed to group of black people in church in the ghetto bulworth begin the speech but suddenly go off track and just start being honest you mean one lady asks the democratic party doesn care about the african american community well he shout laughing isn that obvious the story is propelled by device in which bulworth put out contract on his own life he mus later that it a bad thing to make decision when you re suicidal he keep seeing man in sunglass graham beckel whom he belief to be the hitman bulworth also meet nina halle berry with whom he becomes infatuated suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworth no nonsense truth in politics method become national sensation and he shoot ahead in the poll despite the fact that he appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentence beatty work on both side of the camera is excellent his script and direction are both extremely sharp a is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself here is man who reached his limit and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure like that the film doesn take clear shot at any of the political party or affiliation but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich although the anti rich sentiment do get bit tiresome by the end of the film some of the segment are simply hilarious such a lengthy rap that he delivers at luncheon dedicated to him much of the film is completely absurd but that the fun part about it it an angry serious film at the core but the package that beatty ha created is so much more accessible than recent attempt in the genre what add to this feeling is beatty portrayal of bulworth this is performance that deserves recognition on higher scale beatty is so much fun to watch here he always funny but he also subtle in way that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable action beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcoming a human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning the supporting cast is vast and colorful berry is luminous a always and add to her repertoire of solid supporting role don cheadle ha good role a drug dealer who us gun toting toddler to do his dirty work oliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday fear he may induce heart attack with the intensity of his acting though he very funny to watch paul sorvino add the southern accent to his list of mastered inflection is bulworth offensive suppose some may see it that way wasn offended by the film but then again hardly care about politics think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story the film isn perfect of course the ending didn quite work for me and the few of the scene between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic but these are minor quibble about an otherwise brilliant film bulworth is smart uproariously funny picture that prof to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface\n","call 911 for the cliche police if you must but the eye are the window to the soul the finest actor working in film are those who can command the screen with gaze paul newman ralph fiennes anthony hopkins morgan freeman you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying word that there is something going on in their mind that the character they play are real human being we will never have chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been great actor but he had that unique quality in his eye in gridlock an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire shakur and his co star tim roth take sketchy character and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry shakur and roth play ezekiel spoon whitmore and alexander stretch rome two detroit buddy who share spoken word jazz trio an apartment and drug addiction with cookie thandie newton when new year eve party end with cookie comatose after drug overdose spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time they soon make new year resolution to get into rehab but that prof to be easier said than done a though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough spoon and stretch also find their attempt to get clean hitting road block of bureaucracy confusion and red tape the government might be the least of their obstacle however a they find themselves suspect in the murder of drug dealer and on the run from nasty thug vondie curtis hall in order for you to buy into gridlock at all you have to accept it a surreal odyssey rather than a urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government office on new year day in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all gridlock may actually be response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey 1991 falling down which found besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during trek through inner city los angeles in falling down michael douglas fen the character personalized license plate echoed in gridlock by the drug lord reper plate whip out gun because he can get breakfast at mcdonald in gridlock spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demand placed on them before they can get into rehab center and where the unhinged fen became heroic surrogate for audience writer director vondie curtis hall refuse to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation one bureaucrat responds to tirade from stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just because you picked _today_ to clean up the world in gridlock is just a frustrating a the world in falling down but the cathartic moment yield no easy answer this time hall ha some interesting thing to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them significant chunk of gridlock is devoted to spoon and stretch flight from reper and from the police and those sub plot serve up some thoroughly predictable moment in one scene stretch scare off reper by getting chummy with police officer another present that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected hero in public place watching television news report of the crime which show their picture the entire sequence of event seems designed merely a an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot ha them standing in line or sitting down much of the time hall also play with gratuitous insert of drug paraphernalia and flashback to the day before the film main event perhaps making particular effort to point out the talent the character are wasting through self destructive behavior oh the irony of it tupac shakur made career in music and movie playing the hard case and living the life to back it up in gridlock shakur get the chance to play someone who ha seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scare him spoon is an idea for character at best a written by hall but shakur display an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction mostly it come through those eye eye with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta it is spoon who play conscience to stretch pure appetite and roth play stretch with gleeful self destructiveness he reveals that he is hiv positive even a he is preparing to shoot up again which is a much an obstacle to spoon goal a any agency or enemy gridlock s most cruelly comic scene find stretch helping spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with tiny pocket knife and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keep ha slowly drained the life out of him with friend like that spoon doesn need enemy and shakur look at stretch with the tired eye of man who ha seen too much the tragedy now is that we won get more chance to see those eye again\n","the happy bastard quick movie review damn that y2k bug

story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably the plot isn particularly interesting in the first place traditional mildly hackneyed and not very involving this is sort of brooding film our protagonist doesn speak much and the action sequence are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude felt like the director wasn very interested in the proceeding himself

not much in the way of stature but he ha surprisingly imposing physical presence that work to his advantage here peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor he shy quiet but always effective he adept at conveying emotion through speech rather than expression his feeling don always show on his face by you can always tell what they are this is basically conventional thriller told in pretentiously bizarre fashion why soderbergh couldn just parrot down and tell story don know but what he doe do certainly doesn work the result is wild cornucopia of image that amount to precisely nil

to gain the woman favor he take picture of her and kill number of people in his way comment stalked is yet another in seemingly endless string of spurned psycho getting their revenge type movie which are stable category in the 1990s film industry both theatrical and direct to video their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they re typically inexpensive to produce no special effect no big name star and serve a vehicle to flash nudity allowing them to frequent late night cable television stalked waver slightly from the norm in one respect the psycho never actually ha an affair on the contrary he rejected rather quickly the psycho typically is an ex lover ex wife or ex husband other than that stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelf and viewed after midnight on cable stalked doe not provide much suspense though that is what it set out to do interspersed throughout the opening credit for instance serious sounding narrator spout statistic about stalker and ponders what may cause man to stalk it implicitly implied that all stalker are men while picture of boy are shown on the screen after these credit snapshot of actor jay underwood appears the narrator state that this is the story of daryl gleason and tell the audience that he is the stalker of course really this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniel if the movie wa meant to be about daryl then it should have been called stalker not stalked okay so we know who the stalker is even before the movie start no guesswork required stalked proceeds then a it begin obvious obvious obvious the opening sequence contrived quite bit brings daryl and brooke the victim together daryl ob over brooke follows her around and try to woo her ultimately rejected by her his plan become more and more desperate and elaborate these plan include the all time psycho in love cliche the murdered pet for some reason this genre film require dead pet to be found by the victim stalked stalked is no exception it a cat this time found in the shower event like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked where only one survives guess who it invariably always is and you ll guess the conclusion to this turkey stalked cast is uniformly adequate not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either jay underwood a the stalker turn toward melodrama bit too much he overdoes it in other word but he still manages to be creepy enough to pas a the type of stalker the story demand maryam abo about the only actor close to being star here she played the bond chick in the living daylight is equally adequate a the stalked of the title even though she seems too ditzy at time to be strong independent business owner brooke abo need to be ditzy however for the plot to proceed toward the end for example brooke ha her suspicion about daryl to ensure he won use it a another excuse to see her brooke decides to return toolbox he had left at her place to his house doe she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answer of course not she try the door open it and wanders around the house when daryl return he enters the house of course so our heroine is in danger somehow even though her car is parked at the front of the house right by the front door daryl is oblivious to her presence inside the whole episode place an incredible strain on the audience suspension of disbelief and question the validity of either character intelligence stalked receives two star because even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring it is not so bad that it cannot be watched rated mostly for several murder scene and brief nudity in strip bar it is not a offensive a many other thriller in this genre are if you re in the mood for good

bird eye view shot of sprawling martian metropolis reddish also state of the art special effect have never been carpenter trademark and once again the writer director who seems to have no problem finding work however doesn waste any of the film budget in that department ghost of mar is lock laughing stock and barrel all your standard carpenter fare dingy interior cluttered exterior inane dialogue lot of leather scarred crazed looking alien and lot and lot of weaponry the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning spontaneously stupidly carpenter might like to think he made western here but it a western without any real hero villain or border conflict it just the shootout minus hissing snake plissken never thought d miss the guy but do it not all the same however dubbed the one note wonder for his minimalist music soundtrack carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic yet effective scoring by highlighting his action with loud screeching guitar work

last year or so what with the stillborn mission to mar and red planet with val kilmer ghost of mar sadly add to those disappointing return in it opening weekend it wa overshadowed by bunch of sequel among them american pie 2 and rush hour 2 the irony is that the mar in carpenter film feel sadly absent there are occasional reference to the red planet of course but the film might a well have been

various successful sci fi film such a close encounter of the third kind 2001 space odyssey apollo 13 and contact well whatever it is you sure a hell hope that it would be thousand time better than this shoddy attempt at such melange considering the disastrous result we re left with here this is film that take little bit of everything but ultimately add up to lot of nothing it like said this movie suck plot rescue crew of astronaut is sent down to mar in the year 2020 after an unknown energy force lead to loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviator to visit the red planet critique extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie uneven would be another the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the buzz around it had been so so and even the film itself start off with decent first twenty minute all leading you to believe that it actually going to go somewhere but it isn long before the entire movie downshift into neutral feature more space walk than anything interesting on the cherry colored planet try too hard to get u into the pain of some it character and unsuccessfully toss some romance into the mix in sci fi movie well don know much of it just seemed like bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and half only to figure out some big secret in the end secret which practically had me yawning with excitement ultimately this is movie that start off with decent premise join the crew in their misadventure in space for the main crux of it journey and eventually settle down for one of the most anti climactic ending this side of contact mind you if you enjoyed that film shrug of the shoulder ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty a well of course don remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effect at it end of story ugh what friggin mess film like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again didn anybody recognize the crappiness in this script didn they read the bad dialogue the cheezy line the obvious derivative nature of the work mind you with director like depalma at the helm that ain saying much of course you can really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry connell in this fine crew of thespian nuff said neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film musical score during the last fifteen minute presumably in order to wake the audience up okay we get it brian this scene is supposed to be powerful wow yawn my ear hurt so is anything salvageable in this movie sure gary sinise doe another great job a doe cheadle the film doesn completely bore you a much a it just move along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sand twister effect that you see in the commercial is well done other than that guess could say that admire how filmmaker have become so much more devious in their product placement strategy oops did say admire meant am disgusted all in all this movie delivers very little in actual substance offer two bit dialogue masked in lot of sci fi mumbo jumbo pretend to be deep when really it just sappy and eventually just settle into an ending which other than presenting u with pathetic computer graphic a part of the story give u little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck go see the ninth gate now there a great movie and on personal note think it time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12 minute uninterrupted film sequence and start worrying more about how crappy his movie are getting\n","lengthy and lousy are two word to describe the boring drama the english patient great acting music and cinematography were nice but too many dull sub plot and character made the film hard to follow ralph fiennes strange day schindler list give gripping performance a count laszlo almasy victim of amnesia and horrible burn after world war ii in italy the story revolves around his past in flashback form making it even more confusing anyway he is taken in by hana juliette binoche the horseman on the roof boring war torn nurse she wa never really made into anything until she met an indian towards the end developing yet another sub plot count almasy begin to remember what happened to him a it is explained by stranger willem dafoe basquiat his love kirstin scott thomas mission impossible wa severely injured in plane crash and eventually died in cave he returned to find her dead and wa heart broken so he flew her dead body somewhere but wa shot down from the ground don get the wrong idea it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting but good is the last thing this film is maybe if it were an hour le it may have been tolerable but 2 hour and 40 minute of talking is too much to handle the only redeeming quality about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography other than these the english patient is full of worthless scene of boredom and waste entirely too much film\n","capsule where are you tonight leni rienfenstal starship trooper is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography and bad pornography at that it is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun it so cynically calculatedly bone headed that even the least demanding member of the audience wa with were alternately bored and revulsed it one of the worst movie ve seen in long time why am calling this movie pornography pornography in the abstract is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instinct remember reading review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie where private joker ha to shoot the downed vc sniper a near pornographic eternity didn agree with that assessment but could see what wa being implied the reviewer felt a if the audience wa being incited to stand up and pump their fist and shout do er man do er that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship trooper it literally like giant recruitment film that ha gone berserk it try frantically to enlist our emotion but it wind up only being dull or sickening the film take place in our future when earth ha come under attack by some alien specie that doesn appear to have intelligence to counterattack humankind doe the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which they re clearly capable of they send down grunt with 16 rifle this isn heinlein it a bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious point of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scene that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome one scene ha journalist on battlefield filimg soldier being slaughtered and end with groaning predictability said cameraman get skewered too the soldier and their commander are consistently idiotic they do not posse germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense they don even behave like soldier in bad movie and therefore we don care about them we hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate here we don even hate the bug what there to hate hating them would be like cursing hurricaine if there anything really hateful there the movie doesn know how to give it to u the screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps better appelation would be screen typist and director the increasingly talent impaired paul verhoeven have not found any way to make the character or the story serve each other one of the subplots concern woman pilot who great at getting out of tight situation and doe it again and again and again once or twice is fine by the fifth or sixth time it worn out it welcome there never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle also the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bug are to earthling weaponry if bug ha one of the human screaming in it grasp then five guy can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing damned thing but if one human get cornered he lay waste to whole platoon of bug with one clip uh huh the very worst feature of the movie is it repulsive quasi fascist flavor say quasi because while the movie us many of the trapping of fascism ot eroticize it action the gear the uniform etc the movie doesn have the nerve or the brain to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject the bumper between scene which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bug look relatively innocuous in comparison like the rest of the movie there more suppose but it not worth it the acting is bland neither arsenic nor gravy the music disposable the camerawork turgid the heartbreaking thing is that it make independence day look like masterpiece\n","capsule in 2176 on the planet mar police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace there is lot of fighting and not whole lot of story otherwise john carpenter reprises so many idea from his previous film especially assault on precinct 13 that the new film come off a his homage to himself 0 4 to 4 john carpenter apparently belief that action scene in which people fight something horrible are the same a horror scene for writer and director of horror film supposedly an expert on horror it is very bad mistake to make ghost of mar is called horror movie but it is more just drawn out fight between human and surprisingly low powered alien menace in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghost of mar carpenter would have ground to sue this film is just chock full of piece taken from assault on precinct 13 the thing and prince of darkness it is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many piece of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way but that still doe not make for really good science fiction experience ghost of mar take place in the year 2176 mar ha been mostly terraformed so that human can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the film budget it is never mentioned but the gravity on mar ha been increased somehow to earth normal again making it easier to film society ha changed bit by that time but it ha advanced surprisingly little apparently the culture ha changed so that woman are much more in position of control and from carpenter view woman have really made mess of thing society ha stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advance society ha changed le in 175 year than we might expect it to change in ten the basic plot of ghost of mar ha much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 yes precinct 9 ha been replaced by somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony instead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film ha the criminal desolation williams instead of facing hoodlum with automatic weapon the police face well ghost of mar because the ghost are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave a human savage in another lapse of imagination the story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback ghost of mar take place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tone of red yellow and black carpenter manages to give u powerful opening scene showing mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with heavy beat sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup the terror he creates look little too much like fugitive wannabe from the rock band kiss his idea of building suspense is having bunch of sudden jump scene that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring these are standard haunted house film shock effect that require no great talent to give the audience somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitation in some of the fight within short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mar red planet and ghost of mar after mission to mar wa panned by too many reviewer it look better and better and better a time go by rate ghost of mar 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the 4 to 4 scale following the movie showed my wife who liked ghost of mar moderately more than did carpenter classic assault on precinct 13 her comment is that it wa seeing the same film twice\n","will hunting matt damon is natural genius for movie character that usually death sentence it a trait associated with what my brother call too good for this world movie like phenomenon or powder forgive me for spoiling the ending but will doesn die this is no formula movie in fact it quite fresh and original it a character study more than anything and that not surprising considering it wa written by two actor damon and co star ben affleck will work whatever kind of job he can get first he a janitor then he work construction off screen he speed read book on any academic subject that

for one of his fight lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time a long a will agrees to therapy session and to discussing mathematics with him will barely decides to go for the therapy over prison lambeau treat will like son he proud of and amazed by will accomplishment in mathematics he encourages will and try to give him structure knowing that with little discipline he could be bigger than einstein will isn really interested in academia he know he would be the best in his field and therefore spend all of his time in an office explaining math to people like lambeau he would rather work construction which break lambeau heart meanwhile will attends his mandated therapy session it not long before he shred all the therapist on lambeau a list will ha read enough psychology to know the trick of the trade and how to keep them from affecting him shrink after shrink refuse to return after will mockery lambeau last hope is his old college roommate now psychology teacher at small time community college knowing that will is going to try to shred him too sean robin williams agrees to take him on a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein true to form will find sean emotional weakness and attack but unlike the other shrink sean know what he is in for and continues the session like foster mother with fussy child sean know that the attack are defensive and is able to take them in stride like the foster mother sean know that time and quiet patience is the only approach robin williams is excellent in this role he not an actor with great range but in the right role he ha great depth in this movie a in awakening there come point when the quiet shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance and smile of pure joy spread up to his eye williams is the only actor can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling have compared will to foster child and that not entirely fair emotionally he ha lot to learn but he is not child he ha thought about his life and made rational decision about what he want sean his girlfriend his pal and lambeau all help him grow but he didn start out asking for or particularly needing help his exceptional gift singled him out and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction if had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walk the line between drama and melodrama it too sentimental and uplifiting for straight drama but the emotion are too subtle for melodrama it is emotionally engaging but it not quite larger than life this isn a problem per se but at time didn know quite how to take it but this is relatively small complaint about very good movie good movie allows it character to learn and grow it doesn just happen it take good script good acting and

girlfriend continues to see him in her life and ha nightmare what the deal watch the movie and sorta find out critique mind fuck movie for the teen generation that touch on very cool idea but present it in very bad package which is what make this review an even harder one to write since generally applaud film which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad way of making all type of film and these folk just didn snag this one correctly they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly so what are the problem with the movie well it main problem is that it simply too jumbled it start off normal but then downshift into this fantasy world in which you a an audience member have no idea what going on there are dream there are character coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparition there are disappearance there are looooot of chase scene there are ton of weird thing that happen and most of it is simply not explained now personally don mind trying to unravel film every now and then but when all it doe is give me the same clue over and over again get kind of fed up after while which is this film biggest problem it obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until it final five minute and do they make thing entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime not really the sad part is that the arrow and both dig on flick like this so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make little bit of sense but it still didn the make the film all that more entertaining guess the bottom line with movie like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from vision for about 20 minute throughout the movie is just plain lazy okay we get it there are people chasing her and we don know who they are do we really need to see it over and over again how about giving u different scene offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie apparently the studio took this film away from it director and chopped it up themselves and it show there might ve been pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere but guess the suit decided that turning it into music video with little edge would make more sense the actor are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in new neighborhood but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who hold her own throughout the entire film and actually ha you feeling her character unraveling overall the film doesn stick because it doesn entertain it confusing it rarely excites and it feel pretty redundant for most of it runtime despite pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it oh and by the way this is not horror or teen slasher flick it just packaged to look that way because

of bored foul mouthed florida teen having sex doing drug having sex listening to eminem having sex playing video game having sex and killing one of their peer then bully for you based on jim schutze novelization of true life event bully chart the story of handful of disenchanted teenager who in 1993 murdered their high school bully in cold calculated blood the film could have provided fascinating insight into what turned these aimless kid into premeditated killer in the hand of controversial director larry clark kid however it ha le to say about it subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker pornographic proclivity in term of the incident and what provoked it bully stir up nothing new the high schoolers are presented a uniformly screwed up lot bored with life not much ambition promiscuous profane the bully in question bobby kent nick stahl is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn exactly tower over his colleague in the pathological department he hound and harries and humiliates his best friend marty played by brad renfro and marty girlfriend lisa rachel miner doesn care for it at all and come up with the idea of killing bobby simply remove him from the equation marty and lisa and handful of their promiscuous profane and stoner friend plus recruited hit man lure bobby to swamp one night stab him beat him over the head with baseball bat and dump him into the canal where the sand crab and the gator presumably finish him off there no remorse the next day they re talking about it a openly a homework assignment they did it because they wanted to and because they could what most troubling about the film however isn the unsettling subject matter and the matter of fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in bully but there also an uneasy exploitative feel to it gratuitous crotch shot abound one of which make the zipper cut away in there something about mary look like the height of subtlety clark is so pre occupied with his female predominantly lead that you forget at time what this movie is supposed to be about the stripping bare literally and figuratively of these actor who are after all playing underage teenager becomes harder to watch over time a you begin to feel for them and question the

have proven that when it come to going to the dog more is definitely not the merrier 1996 101 dalmatian certainly wasn the greatest movie going experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous larger than life performance in addition we had two amiable lead in the form of jeff daniel and joely richardson and lot and lot of adorable spotted puppy this time around there seem to be fewer puppy on the screen and close facial and physical gyration are starting to feel a old a the 53 year old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers but that only half the problem with kevin lima laborious film what make 102 dalmatian such collosal bore is it embarrassing attempt at humor here almost single handedly foisted on wisecracking macaw who think he a dog voiced by eric idle it rabid plotlessness cruella go after puppy again wind up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actor who play the romantic hero of the piece welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander than bland alice evans a parole officer named chlo gruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans can even aspire to that the dog upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even close split end are more animated bad acting however seems to be requirement for this sequel since rard depardieu show up a french furrier with haircut like robert de niro in men of honor jean pierre le pelt is flamboyant fashion designer with penchant for fine fur and depardieu over the top antic mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail france most popular export besides brie ha long since turned into caricature of himself and in 102 dalmatian the producer milk that realization for all it worth le pelt like to refer to the furry little critter a poopies par example and ad nauseum the finesse of the script attributed to four screenwriter no le and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it take for paroled cruella to be shaken from her year of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben that done it back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off limit sable and mink and plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of hooded designer gown the dog are pretty cute try making puppy look otherwise but that pretty much all they are there always the feeling that there a trainer off in the wing coaxing the dog to open door or pick up their food bowl in unison or pop tape into the videocasette recorder savvy holiday goer should skip 102 dalmatian and pop the original 1961 animated classic into their vcr instead it one dalmatian le but 101 more satisfying\n","my giant is two movie for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free a lamely directed by michael lehmann the picture try to be comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book without goliath david is just some punk throwing rock languidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious a the screenplay by david seltzer the omen meander toward it sad ending since it rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmaker thought they were doing remains mystery other than few nice visuals there nothing to recommend the picture with great film comedy under his belt from when harry met sally to the original city slicker billy crystal ha shown that he more than the world best oscar host he doe however have propensity for choosing hopeless material a in last year father day and this year my giant one wonder if he read the script before agreeing to go ahead with project surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there wa nothing there perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success or maybe he want to be dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie somber tone the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably

possible sammy crystal an agent currently without client is rescued after car accident by sweet romanian giant named max muresan after throwing out constant one liner either god is in the salvage

it wa good idea couple year ago with the truth about cat and dog but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker this is by the book movie that plod along on predestined course with no surprise and very few laugh it also jump on the ever popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too garofalo play campaign aide to massacusetts senator jay sander running for reelection denis leary play the stereotypical strategist with no ethic who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish root and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that made the kennedy family so popular so leary order garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relative to exploit she soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movie like this the matchmaker fall for every cliche of thing that can go wrong garofalo ha to take tiny plane to ireland almost miss the bus to town can get hotel room end up in the smallest trashiest one around ha dog piss on her luggage and so on then come what roger ebert call the meet cute it happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way in the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walk into her hotel bathroom and find nude sean david hara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side no point for guessing it the same dog that just made water on her luggage also no point for guessing garofalo hate hara on sight that how it work in movie like these know from the instant saw that irishman in the bathtub that she hate him for awhile then succumb to his charm live happily for reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which they reconcile in time for happy irish tune to play over the end credit haven mentioned the movie twist yet garofalo come to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folk from around the county pair off into future of bliss milo shea who look like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pop onscreen occasionally to spew his word of wisdom and bring lonely soul together rest assured he ll do all he can to match up garofalo and hara oh and in keeping with the matchmaker utter predictability he dy toward the end what the message here sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with weak script wa excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scene together leary stay stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole he even undoes himself with the old microphone still on after he done giving the speech cliche both of them should have known better\n","sean connery star a harvard law professor who head back into the courtroom by way of the everglades to defend young educated black man blair underwood the guy is on death row for the murder of white girl and say that his confession wa coerced from the region tough black cop lawrence fishburne watching connery and fishburne bump head for two hour is amusing enough but the plot a joke there no logic at work here tone is also an issue there is none director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say is it statement on human right is it knock off of silence of the lamb glimcher never tell instead he force his character to jump through hoop after hoop over drawbridge after drawbridge hoping that the audience won notice what missing just awful the

the author play this year it salome for about an hour there a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working class stiff conflict arises but it small stuff an administrator from the bus company here an outraged catholic pork butcher michael gambon there but with finney at the wheel so to speak the film roll smoothly over these plot point just like the gorgeous leland double decker bus in the story where thing get serious is toward the end of the film when the plot take turn that the bus never would and the story head down very dark alley that mark the end of an enjoyable ride the twist make sense and help paint complete picture of finney character but the trip to get there betrays the light airy atmosphere of what had come before it not fatal misstep mind you and it doesn send the

unbelievably disappointing it not just because this is brian depalma film and since he a great director and one who film are always greeted with at least some fanfare and it not even because this wa film starring nicolas cage and since he give brauvara performance this film is hardly worth his talent it worse than that it aggravating for the sole reason that it story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it open up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie make on wrong turn that lead it to the hall of fame of half assedness or more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighth assedness in certain circle snake eye wa being advertised a kind of modern day version of kurosawa classic rashomon where crime is told from the four different and mean different perspective and it look a though it may actually be just like this with the opening which might add is superb in one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before boxing match a he talk on his cell phone with his wife interupts pay per view event on tv chase down gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talk with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise who character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn who also in this and watch a it happens there a big name in the crowd and that the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani who sitting behind rick and who get shot second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out this all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many red herring and possibility of what happened that it open this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this film asks and it set this film up extremely well for when rick begin to question people and get different perspective on the scene and discovers there a very good possibility it wa conspiracy a we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet woman who wa talking to kirkland before he wa shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in panic and try to hide from the cop in the arena and the adjacent casino hotel since the cop have blocked off the door so they can get witness take on what happened this is all going pretty fine and dandy and it extremely interesting to watch then it take one wrong step we follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out but that not the worst part of it it that it the one person you didn think it would be because he wa too obviously supposed to be the red herring the one you didn think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it it only get worse the film turn into chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we can rely on rick investigation to be all that interesting it a if the film ran out of the gut to be really complex and original about third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it ha to become le and le credible event become more and more proposterous and by the end the film ha decided to rely on the worst offender in mystery like this the deux ex machina that where some outside intereference brings the film to sudden conclusion and make everything okay this time it a hurricane an out of control police car and big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective field and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mystery such a this depalma who idolizes hitchcock to death ha done many film like this such a his masterpiece blow out where movie soundman us movie element to uncover conspiracy piece by piece but granted depalma at least make it intriguing to watch what with his over the top shot set ups notably the beginning and sequence where the camera pan over top of bunch of room in the hotel forgetting anything about boundary at least his direction make up partly for it then there koepp who showed such great ability at making character flaw come to life like he did in depalma earlier carlito way film that dove right into the life and past of it character and examined him extremely well he can write flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just half assed effort he flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasn so formulaic scene towards the end where he ha to make fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer ha no emotional buildup he may a well have said the opposite of what he say it would have at least gone with what the character wa like this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promise intelligence and complexity because it promise disection of flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pull the rug from under u just a we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way a wa watching the first half hour couldn wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspective he be given and perhaps he have to make choice between who he ha to believe now there a film unfortunately the film ha two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about half hour in when the film go into autopilot and becomes stale and recycled piece of crap we ve seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma\n","every now and then movie come along from suspect studio with every indication that it will be stinker and to everybody surprise perhaps even the studio the film becomes critical darling mtv film _election high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is current example did anybody know this film existed week before it opened the plot is deceptively simple george washington carver high school is having student election tracy flick reese witherspoon is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question way way high mr matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul popular but slow jock to run and paul nihilistic sister jump in the race a well for personal reason the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectation were so low going in the fact that this wa quality stuff made the review even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be you can help going in with the baggage of glowing review which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewer were likely to have _election good film doe not live up to it hype what make _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot detail lifted directly from _rushmore_ released few month earlier the similarity are staggering tracy flick _election_ is the president of an extraordinary number of club and is involved with the school play max fischer _rushmore_ is the president of an extraordinary number of club and is involved with the school play the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between teacher and his student the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between teacher and his student tracy flick is from single parent home which ha contributed to her drive max fischer is from single parent home which ha contributed to his drive the male bumbling adult in _election_ matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair get caught and his whole life is ruined he even get bee sting the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ bill murray pursues an extramarital affair get caught and his whole life is ruined he get several bee sting and so on what happened how is it that an individual screenplay _rushmore_ and novel _election_ contain so many significant plot point and yet both film were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studio from genre the high school geek revenge movie that hadn been fully formed yet even so the strength of _election_ rely upon it fantastic performance from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell a paul anti social sister tammy broderick here is playing the mr rooney role from _ferris bueller_ and he seems to be having the most fun he had since then witherspoon is revelation it early in the year it a comedy and teenager have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination and once campbell character get going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then you re won over one thing that been bothering me since ve seen it there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film suppose that coming from mtv film should expect no le but the film start off light and airy like sitcom a the screw tighten and the tension mount alexander payne decides to add element that frankly distract from the story it is bad enough that mr doesn like tracy determination to win at all cost but did they have to throw in the student teacher relationship even so there no logical reason why mr ha an affair when he doe there a lot to like in _election_ but the plot similarity to _rushmore_ and the tonal nosedive it take a it get explicitly sex driven mark this a disappointment\n","best remembered for his understated performance a dr hannibal lecter in michael mann forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he work on usually playing bit role in some studio schlock he dy halfway through the long kiss goodnight he only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work a dogged police inspector opposite france mcdormand in ken loach hidden agenda cox play the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick i which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributor were scared to budge big john feel the love that dare not speak it name but he express it through seeking out adolescent and bringing them back to his pad what bothered some audience member wa the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light he an even tempered funny robust old man who actually listens to the kid problem a opposed to their parent and friend both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused life he ll have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship charming them with temptation from the grown up world i stand for long island expressway which slice through the strip mall and middle class home of suburbia filmmaker michael cuesta us it a pretty transparent metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15 year old protagonist howie paul franklin dano in his opening voice over howie reveals morbid preoccupation with death on the road citing the i highway death of filmmaker alan pakula songwriter harry chapin and his own mother on exit 52 he both fascinated and disturbed by the i and those feeling are projected onto big john who follows howie around in his bright red car but never make move to force the boy to do something he doesn want to do this make him much more complex than the usual child molester seen in movie he a beast but ashamed of it i would have worked best a half hour short film about howie ill advised foray into big john haven there is unnecessary padding with howie miserable dad bruce altman in the hot seat for white collar crime degenerate youngster who get their kick from robbing middle class house and some homoerotic shenanigan with wise as gary terrio billy kay handsome artful dodger rather than add to the theme of suburban ennui not that we needed another movie on that subject these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length concurrently the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted cox sporting baseball cap and faded marine tattoo is all bluff and bluster dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn a to be transparent we re so used to child actor whose dramatic choice are broad and obvious calling haley joel it surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene the restraint is admirable but i s screenplay doesn always give them the best material when howie read big john walt whitman poem the moment feel bit too precious director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john who may a well be hearing glenn gould performing bach goldberg variation it too much there are also some obvious dramatic contrivance involving big john other boy toy walter masterson jealous over the newbie this plot thread predictably lead to violence not content to be haunting observational portrait of teen alienation in royally screwed up world like terry zwigoff superb ghost world cuesta lack the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note it typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap thing up with bullet sparing the writer from actually having to come up with complex philosophical note in this regard i and countless other indie film share something in common with blockbuster action film problem are solved when the obstacle is removed how often doe real life work this way to extend the question if movie is striving for realism do dramatic contrivance destroy the illusion\n","some movie should just skip my daughter and had really vile time at my favorite martian few week back and here come another disney effect filled live action flick based on an old tv program true the probgram is only 15 year old this time and it a cartoon but it a cartoon liked and wa understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen but my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be turn out wa right mostly inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format a my favorite martian down to the jive talking side kick at first thought it wa done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig wa directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm wa directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver this odd similarity between the two movie may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isn just business it a way of life the producer who obviously micromanaged the two project should get prominant screen credit in some part you can just hear them saying more zany want more zany here and here let have really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful want the audience squirming in their seat ok that fine but want you to add bug gut what doe this scene do character depth but where the zaniness don see zany here if you can make it zany cut it the latter is the only explanation can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie michelle who play penny gadget niece shine in every scene she in but unfortunately she only get about nine minute of screen time my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor dabney coleman comedic talent are utterly wasted a chief quimby kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he doe the best he can with some really poor line in few unexceptional scene he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri a the gidget bitch from hell town mayor oteri overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech pattern and mannerism were so much like portland oregon own manic mayor vera katz that had to wonder if the studio wasn poking fun at our fair town or maybe all career politician are like that must say matthew broderick doe not stroll through inspector gadget a he did godzilla he appears to have some fun with the film especially a the evil gadget rupert everett is entertaining a the maniacle claw joely fisher doe fine a the zany scientist and even better a the zany carbon copy of herself her performance is one of the few thing worth watching in the film l hughley play the shuckin and jivin vehicular side kick in role that firmly set emancipation back 20 year the dialog is let face it it pretty bad the tag line after major set piece battle is faux pa that make no sense in context lot of the line especially hughley appear to be made up a they go along by people with little gift for ad lib about three quarter of the film is somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercation not really battle with the evil gadget penny doe about minute and half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon let me rage here just for minute michelle trachtenberg wa an excellent choice for the penny character she utterly charming and ha excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pint size detective why she is so underutilized in this film is real mystery the film loses star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity inspector gadget is missing the long long stretch of potty humor that among other thing made my favorite martian so unbearable but it a very short movie so perhaps something wa cut at the last moment probably the best scene in the film occur during the end credit the evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and ha an amazing number of cameo appearance for the few second it onscreen all in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action film wonder if disney us the revenue for it generally money making cartoon to produce these loser but if true why if they re trying for another mary poppins they need to find team that can produce one and then give them chance to do it\n","at first glance it appears that the home alone movie are brainless slapstick intended for those with mind of 8 year old that true of home alone 2 and d bet money that it true of home alone 3 opening soon but home alone actually ha lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesn get in the way the mcalisters all 15 of them are going to france for the holiday four adult and eleven kid are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kid cruelty kevin patience run out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza ha already been eaten and he going to have to starve he attack his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drink all over the table few cousin and an uncle the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin nobody came to his rescue when he wa being teased but they all point their finger when he fight back the ultimate punishment come from mom catherine hara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night on his way up the stair he tell her that family suck and that he hope never to see any of his family again that night the power go out knocking out the alarm clock so the mcalisters wake up in big hurry to get to the airport in surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family head off without him it interesting that in subtle way his parent never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their child first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kid in coach while they fly first class they re two third of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing child meanwhile kevin belief that somehow his wish ha come true he finally rid of his family life is dream come true he can jump on the bed watch rated movie eat gob of ice cream and potato chip and dig through his big brother secret box slowly the novelty wear off and he settle into the mundane he groom himself he doe the laundry he go shopping bought some milk egg and fabric softener he also start to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring the furnace in the basement is scary monster the old man next door is snow shovel murderer and two crook are trying to break into his house macaulay culkin is cute but he isn much of an actor still we can see that kevin character grows thanks to some good direction and editing for example acting ha little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin search out seasonal santa at night just a santa is getting in his car kevin asks the man to pas on his request he want his family back to the real santa he learned how to deal with the furnace you turn on the light and it not so scary anymore he go to church one evening and there he see the snow shovel murderer who actually turn out to be nice man they talk about their fear and kevin learns that age alone doe not make you le afraid finally in the last 20 minute kevin confronts his last fear the bandit head on literally this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movie genuine dramatic setup it is dessert it a lot of fun and it doesn overwhelm the rest of the movie on the whole home alone is great holiday movie john williams original score ha the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the mall and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gathering but it doe have it flaw the smallest problem is that culkin doesn act very well a said before he is cute but repeated viewing reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin insight into his character the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villain threaten kevin life about five time instead of m gonna get that kid they say m gonna kill that kid some might argue that the tone is the same but strongly disagree mixing comedy with specific and viable threat of murder is sociopathic faux pa ll probably never see home alone 3 and wish had skipped home alone 2 but do enjoy home alone almost every year don let your impression of the others detract from the original which ha much more to offer than cartoon slapstick\n","synopsis bobby garfield yelchin life in small town with

enigmatic man to whom bobby take an immediate liking a the bond between bobby and ted deepens bobby becomes privy to ted great secret an event which will change both of their life forever review small but enchanting movie heart in atlantis easily recall another king inspired coming of age film stand by me both in term of it setting and the sentiment it conveys heart is tribute to the magic of childhood to those summer when the day seem neverending and nothing mean more than your closest friend unlike stand by me there is supernatural element to heart but although it is key to the plot it is not prominent like stand by me this is mostly character driven film and a such it benefit greatly from superb casting yelchin is very good a bobby finding good mix of innocence and resignation more

seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credit altogether ve heard about this kind of thing happening before and it make me wonder how much input studio ha over the film they produce a it is found american history to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kaye focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of powerful charismatic performance from edward norton it hard to believe that it ha only been two year since norton fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself star norton is one of those performer who becomes his character and his work in american history is one of the very best performance this year he play young man named derek vinyard skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly angelo and sister davin jennifer lien the film open with flashback in which derek brutally kill two black men vandalizing his car we find out that this land him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eye of danny in the present time of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footstep of his brother much of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that lead to derek adoption of white supremacy when derek is released having served three year in prison he find that his brother is now full blown skinhead derek however ha given up the violence and try to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that come with it are bad thing what make this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their belief in disturbingly straightforward term it hard to make controversial movie and not preach but kaye ha found the right note for his material because american history is mainstream film there ha to be redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic partially disagree with this because although do not advocate racism in any way it interesting the way kaye present derek he is loud obnoxious man but he also very smart the reason for why he becomes skinhead are believable his father wa arbitrarily killed by group of black men it clear that he passionate about his belief and that he not just punk looking for an excuse to beat people up of course it help that kaye ha an actor a talented a norton to play this part it astonishing how frightening norton look with shaved head and swastika on his chest in addition to getting the look just right he perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and whole lot of shouting and norton doe it all with ease even when he at his meanest derek ha likable quality to him and that a gutsy approach when telling story about skinhead what add depth to the story is subplot in which the principal of danny school avery brook becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny the other performance are all terrific with standouts from furlong angelo and lien visually the film is very powerful kaye indulges in lot of interesting artistic choice and most of them work nicely lot of slow motion and strange camera angle add to moody atmosphere but like lot of movie lately american history skim past greatness in the last few minute although the climactic scene is very moving the picture end with pretentious preachy resolution featuring brief narration from character who wa killed for movie so smart subtle up until that point it felt like slap in the face to be hand fed theme in such simplistic way it make me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film perhaps this last scene wa the problem it hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with film this good in time when so many movie are timid and weak american history manages to make compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way\n","the most common and in many case the only complaint against francis ford coppola 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented a an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtue like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder age martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean street movie that dealt with lower echelon of organised crime unfortunately for scorsese his film wa unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola influence on mafia portrayal in the movie seventeen year later scorsese returned to mean street of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime this film wa goodfellas epic black comedy which is today considered a one of the best and most influential film of 1990s goodfellas owes some of it initial success and popularity to the fact that it wa based on the true story told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi who would co write the screenplay for the film the book a well a the film chronicled thirty year in the life of henry hill played by ray liotta irish italian criminal from new york at the age of 13 he get recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played by paul sorvino local mob bos and gradually climb up the ladder starting with small errand after couple of year together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito played by joe pesci he join the crew of expert thief led by jimmy conway played by robert de niro three of them spend year a best friend and associate gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprise that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robbery in american history wealth influence and privilege of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen played by lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelity domestic abuse arrest and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business but the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begin to fall apart tommy unpredictable outburst of homicidal violence jimmy reluctance to share his part of the loot with partner and finally henry own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friend goodfellas is an excellent example of film that represents work of film genius in his full glory scorsese managed to create vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradiction that would ripped the film apart in the hand of le talented filmmaker world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating scorsese spare no effort to show u all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny after being exposed to two and half hour of the film and three decade of criminal history based on some notorious real life event the audience understands why the character chose such dangerous life path trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizen scorsese also manages to break viewer moralistic inhibition by showing truly revolting material scene that depict personal tragedy broken home human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience with the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shot character dialogue or narrator commentary goodfellas represents the new standard of black humour that would became very popular few year later during tarantino era even if we don pay attention to skill with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese display his talent of truly original and creative filmmaker first we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used a movie ironic prologue then instead of single narrator scorsese switch to the second character a narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards this multiple point of view both in term of narration and various subjective shot only lengthens the ironic distance towards character and their situation same ironic distance come with extremely effective choice of soundtrack nostalgia for good old time is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop song while depression paranoia and bad time find their expression in more neurotic rock song of late 1960s and 1970s but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used a ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tune make strong and very ironic contrast to the scene of violence and bloodshed however thing most associated with this film is couple of continuo shot that feature character moving through large room and interacting with dozen if not hundred of people such scene although they require very great skill and patience during their shooting became very popular among other director in 1990s fragmentary character of the screenplay which doesn have straight plot and instead base film on series of loosely connected vignette give another interesting opportunity for scorsese he us this structure of film to experiment and most successful of such experiment is hilarious day in life segment near the end of the film another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talent the most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio get overshadowed by two of his friend and colleague joe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his line including ad libs probably represent the most memorable element of the film ray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesn look a the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film liotta henry hill look somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thug liotta on the other hand improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction lorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable a karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool a her husband paul sorvino is also very effective a patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low a pestering small time gangster who unknowingly dig his own grave a combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great film could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time because of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmaker this cinematic gem deserves it rightful place among the best film of 1990s\n","unzipped is cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric ostensibly the film is documentary but use of that term requires stretching it meaning many scene appear staged and great deal of cutting and pasting ha been done in the editing room the cinema verite effect is conceit genuine spontaneity is at premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially would be actress like cindy crawford director douglas keeve who wa mizrahi lover at the time freely admits that he couldn care le about the truth but wa more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion despite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment while it shed only little light on the behind the scene world of the fashion industry it present fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study he funny energetic and eminently quotable he ha unusual view on just about everything from fashion it about woman not wanting to look like cow to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style it almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dog unzipped also give glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turn an idea into dress it almost certainly different that anyone would imagine the designer draw on variety of source for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movie then enlists the aid of ouija board to help form the collection in particular unzipped trace mizrahi development of his fall 1994 line from it inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlight number of prominent model including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista on the technical side number of interesting choice were made in filming unzipped variety of film stock were used super 8 16 mm black and white and 35 mm color there is purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serf a an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audience perspective while black and white is for the behind the scene sequence nevertheless some viewer will be put off by this treatment while unzipped isn an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve ha enough clip of petulant model to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman wa with ready to wear overall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective doe unzipped succeed when the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes that beautiful and liberating it fit perfectly with the image of him that unzipped ha constructed\n","hong kong cinema ha been going through bad spell the last few production have been effect laded action adventure that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same quality of hong kong film in nutshell the current crop of film from hong kong ha been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership lot of hong kong best talent have crossed the pacific to work on s production such talent a jackie chan rush hour chow yun fat anna the king the corrupter and yuen woo ping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed result now we can add two other hong kong filmmaker to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai unfortunately romeo must die bear all the trademark of typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong rhythm the film open in nightclub a an asian couple is necking enter group of chinese gangster led by kai sing russell wong kai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kai bos and leader of the local chinese family battle break out between the bodyguard of the club and kai who handily kick and punch his opponent down it not until club owner silk rapper dmx bear down on kai and his henchman that the fight end the following morning po sing is found dead suspicion escalate a issac day delroy lindo is told of the murder his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plan to move out of the business of corruption and into legitimate venture issac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter the scene shift to prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brother murder he fight with the guard and is dragged off to be disciplined hung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work escaping to the s han set out to find the person responsible for his brother death romeo must die is in many way fun film it is both absurd and assured the basic plot of gangster wanting to become legitimate echo the godfather the relationship between jet li han and aaliyah trish day reminds u of abel ferrera china girl except that romeo must die couple never once exchange more than loving glance towards one another their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history the performance are adequate if not fully acceptable li of course ha the showiest part having to express both an innocent and steadfast determination allayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with certain style and grace it obvious that the camera love her and she is very photogenic but still the part is under written in such way that even poor performance would not have affected it delro lindo a issac day carry himself well in the film an unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turn out the film best performance the other performer are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for b woodside a issac son colin the performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written first time director andrzej bartkowiak doe workmanlike job in handling the film having career a one of the industry best cinematographer bartkiwiak know how to set up his shot and romeo must die doe look good but the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to semblance of life during the fight scene the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such way that we can care about the character or the situation they are in the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of sport center for nfl team is needlessly confusing and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here a anthony anderson a allayah bodyguard maurice ha no comic timing whatsoever the best thing about the film are it fight scene jet li is master of these intricate physical battle one need only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat here jet is given the opportunity to show off in way that lethal weapon 4 jet u debut didn allow unfortunately lot of jet fight are aided with computer effect that detract from his ability and precision also romeo must die must be noted a having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an ray effect that appears three time during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blow on an opponent obviously homage to the famed ray scene from sonny chiba streetfighter the scene here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film it a if the film ha stopped and video game ha been inserted one problem though about the fight scene those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the film are fantasy and are a removed from reality a any anime or cartoon they do have an internal rhythm to them heartbeat so to speak in their choreography the fight scene in hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance this is created by the performance the direction and the editing here in romeo must die there is no staccato every fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring a the editing both cut away from battle at hand and simple follows set pattern the rhythm is monotonous hong kong film ha tempo that change heightening it emotional impact rmd is limited to standard 4 4 tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever fine example of this difference can be found by examining couple of jackie chan film watch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help now look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx there you have heartbeat and emotional draw that doesn let the audience catch it breath the stop and pause for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted here in romeo must die the fight scene have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl jet li is grand and personable screen presence it a shame that his full talent were not used to full effect here one day filmmaker here in the s will stop making film by the number and start to embrace the style and emotion that ha made hong kong action picture such commodity until then we ll be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die\n","plot derek zoolander is male model he is also very dumb and impressionable for that reason he is secretly hired and trained so secret that even he doesn know about it by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia who want to abolish child labor in his country will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed will zoolander ever grace the world his new look is this funny movie find out below critique there a place in our world for stupid comedy film which don pretend to take themselves seriously are based on idiotic premise and filled with dumb joke there also time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history might be an ideal circumstance during which to relax by watching something so completely frivolous well if you re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedy in some time of course comedy a such are usually very subjective and could see how some will see this film simply a stupid and unfunny while others will grant them the stupid but consider it funny instead personally enjoyed it for the most part cracked up loudly during couple of specific sequence and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry snap it wa also nice to see several real life model with small role in the movie not taking themselves too seriously and if you re the type of person who like celebrity cameo in film well don look any further because dozen of famous face show up here including vince vaughn billy zane winona ryder christian slater david duchovny natalie portman and many many others especially liked andy dick complete make over a the masseuse hi larious but with all film of this type there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn work few particular which didn strike my fancy included the bulimia and orgy sequence with christine taylor the break dance fighting and also never get why they use real country in plot like this why not just make up country instead of zeroing in on certain people also could have done with le of the taylor character in general since she wasn all that interesting and seemed to slow thing down every now and then more zoolander dude but those few misstep were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scene which definitely did work for me almost pissed myself during the gas station disaster absolutely adored the walk off contest with david bowie a the judge no le and appreciated many of zoolander moronic one liner wa merman merman and dare you to get his monkey photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie you re monkey derek monkey also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film both of which zipped and zagged and established nice rhythm to it all again it to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer you will likely enjoy many of the quip in the actual picture a well if you thought the trailer wa dumb skip this dodo bird and go rent austin power again or something film from which there is an obvious influence here blue steel baby yeah where joblo coming from austin

recurring and recurring nightmare that she a hired assassin or it about hired assassin who haunted by recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that she honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica it doesn much matter and believe me by the time shattered image run it painful and pedestrian course you won care these two life with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with black wig black emotionless eye and black leather clothing in the seattle based assassin scene and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scene play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it now twice a boring a it might have been it not that complicated plot can be entertaining of course it help if you have interesting character crisp dialogue and modicum of style shattered image isn complex it just stupid and boring parillaud and baldwin who aren exactly shakespearean material to begin with are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their character have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines line like you don beg you insist like that in woman that parillaud character talking to her cat and you re not the reason couldn care le about you huh and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film if you give me couple of minute you know ll charm the pant off you don have that kind of time talking of pant parillaud ha her clothes off faster than you can say point of no return we have come to expect this from billy baldwin but it might have been nice to have learned something about their character first but there nothing to learn karen is a

an elite team of agent led by delroy lindo broken arrow are in tom house and wiring every phone the plot sound average just like most other kidnap movie that you ve already seen and it wa nothing more than that that is until about half way through the movie suddenly tom go to the fox 5 news room and make live broadcast saying this is your ransom but this is a close a you will ever get to it instead am offering this money a reward on your head dead or alive at this point the plot thickened and the unusually slow start of the film turned into suspense filled action film with great stunt the last half of the film is very well done another thing that carry this film are the superb performance by gibson and sinise a they collide in game of wit over their cellular phone for most of the movie owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject it make you wonder what kidnapper did before cell phone before this movie sinise played mostly good guy first in of mouse men then in forrest gump and most recently in apollo 13 but he wa surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of cop gone bad gibson of course wa just being gibson in an oscar worthy performance although most of the scene were quite predictable ransom is very entertaining and suspenseful film\n","mighty joe young blunder about for nearly twenty minute before we actually get to see great big gorilla his entrance however is grand one out from the tree he leap gargantuan and imposing sporting hand big enough to crush volkswagen bug and pair of foot much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have joe bellow at the poacher before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for million of dollar during this scene turned to my friend and said wow that some ape joe is quite gorilla big digital gorilla he run around the field chasing car and people he pick thing up and stare at them pensively he break thing on accident because he just too big to avoid clumsiness joe a special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minute a character he doesn quite register and the story he been put in is a limp a they come the word family entertainment have never been stamp of quality but might joe young is just silly special effect movie pretending to have heart the picture is remake of the 1949 film it mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly a formality the movie also ha few human character the main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent lover of gorilla a child she witnessed group of poacher murder her mother now she life in the jungle to protect the wildlife specifically she out to protect joe giant gorilla who ha been her friend since her childhood soon zoologist gregg hara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poacher want to get joe and sell him to big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill mother so in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poacher in addition the space is way too small for him after all he is really big gorilla and to add to the complication strasser show up under benevolent pretext he tell jill that he ha preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser a the guy who killed jill mother jill of course doesn recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother this is just one of the many example of stupidity in mighty joe young film that fulfills every stereotype that come with special effect film the movie isn really offensive it ha some competent actor few nifty set and lot of scene with big digitized gorilla but the story is really dumb there aren any character and the film isn satisfying on any level beyond it visuals the movie also ha bad dialogue if critic say that film ha bad dialogue it only fair to quote some of it but most of the word spoken in this picture are phrase like joe isn happy and joe isn safe here we need to get joe out of here joe is way too big for that cage don know if these phrase are word for word but they re close a said the character here are only present a formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage paxton and theron are talented performer who deserve to work on script that provides character for them sadly mighty joe young waste them both there are few clever moment although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and a said the digital effect held my attention for at least five minute it certainly not bad film for kid doubt joe will give them nightmare but adult in the audience aren likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla big gorilla is only interesting for little while after that something need to be done with the big gorilla nobody ever figure out what to do with the big gorilla\n","one sided doom and gloom documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race a foretold by the bible orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he along with best selling author hal lindsey discus various prophecy from the bible and relates them to recent well for 1976 anyway event the film is dated badly a many thing that are supposed to happen in the future never do for example the planet of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth we re still here the arm race between the soviet and america wa supposed to kick off the apocalypse we re still here some of the more ludicrous moment come when it alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist also there ten minute of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give u an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like if it anything like it depicted a here then it going to be incredibly boring the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video it contains the film in standard form aspect ratio of 1 33 1 although some moment of stock footage are letterboxed also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey a well a trailer for another recent vci home video release chariot of the god audio is mono dolby digital and the video is fair to good for film like this believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home

most absurd movie rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that go nowhere fast it star thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful a ever a guy named 1900 you heard right his name is in all actuality 1900 he wa born on an ocean liner on 1 1 1900 uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny ship crewman 1900 spends most of his early year hiding in the bowel of the ship because of danny fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matter well when 1900 is about 9 or so he start wondering all around the ship one day he discovers grand piano he sits down and start playing miraculously what come out is beautiful group of onlooker gather to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such young age when one of the people who know 1900 tell him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulation 1900 reply ck the regulation ho ho ho 1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land when he about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody business onboard come another musician his name is max pruitt taylor vince and he play the trumpet after 1900 catch max barfing everywhere during storm he sits him down on the piano next to him take the piano brace off and play while the piano fly all around the hall taking them with it how the chair they re sitting on and the piano don separate don know but this apparently isn the kind of thing we re supposed to ask after that 1900 and max become friend max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but 1900 ha no intention of doing so what more he doesn even want his music to go anywhere without him when record company hears about his talent they come on board to make record of his music but after finding out that gasp they re going to make million of copy he break the record the conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship get off himself he stumble upon record of 1900 music in store the record shouldn exist because 1900 never stepped on dry land and the one record that wa made on the ship wa broken lady and gentleman it a mystery the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are it element we re supposed to be roused by climactic piano duel there isn anything in this movie with the potential to compel 1900 come off a whiny brooding extremely unlikable man can recall single word he said that wa not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life ditto for max who doesn seem to have life outside his friendship with 1900 tim roth play 1900 with about a much panache a fig leaf there no spirit no gusto to the character he insists that he lead happy life on the ship but to u he is dead pruitt taylor vince is little more palatable at least providing moment of comic relief here and there to liven thing up bit the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii a the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenge 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel the legend of 1900 wa made by giuseppe tornatore whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered masterpiece by many this effort is utterly limp and lifeless at once ridiculous boring narrow sighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten\n","when _star wars_ came out some twenty year ago the image of traveling throughout the star ha become commonplace image when the millenium falcon move throughout the star we see constellation meteor shower and cool space ship when han solo go light speed the star change to bright line going towards the viewer in line that converge at an invisible point cool _october sky_ offer much simpler image that of single white dot traveling horizontally across the night sky wa it really only forty year ago when sputnik wa launched and that before then no satellite ever existed have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it wa nearly two generation ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see then technological achievement even though it wa from the russian it sound hokey but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam played by jake gyllenhaal determined to make dent in the space race he becomes transfixed with his desire to make rocket that could fly like the best of them it is film like this that we know the ending a we buy the ticket when lovely teacher miss riley played by laura dern suggests that he enters his finding into the national science fair we know exactly who is going to win but the joy in film like this is in the little detail for example homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class if he ha any strength whatsoever it is an undeterring vision and good organizer it mean that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school who know more about rocket science than he doe it mean that if his father forbids him to shoot rocket on company property that is the entire coal mining town he must walk eight mile one way just to set up the rocket which will fail fail fail and fail again homer dad is played by chris cooper favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ here he play the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ instead of organizing union rally he is the head of the coal miner who is constantly wringing his hand against the union this is will be one of the great unnoticed performance of the year note how multi dimensional his character is he is his son last nemesis a one who most likely interferes with his son dream but he truly love his son and want to see him succeed the only way he know how through coal mining because of his character we can see how far we ve come the revolution of modern technology ha allowed for u to see society advanced at rate far faster than any generation before u we don understand that there were the generation from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise family the paradigm wa shifting under the father foot and he knew of no other life so _october sky_ far from being merely feel good inspirational film offer much food for thought and this is the best type of inspirational film the one that you take something with you btw the final image of the film is just a simple is a strong contrast a the aforementioned horizontal moving white dot against the night sky background another commonplace image to be sure but it must have been breathtaking forty year ago\n","warning contains what the matrix

to happen now wait wait know most of you loved it and m not saying didn like it what m saying is the first half wa extremely slow now seeing the trailer it make you think the whole entire movie is one big special effect show don be fooled this movie ha big story and big chunk of talky moment but will admit the special effect and the acting were above par deserving the rating above ok now to the

lot of fighting bloody violence leather clad machine gun chick gooey self healing bullet hole scatological humor and man eating monster it not only appears to have been tailor made for swarm of 12 and 13 year old boy it appears to have been made by them in classic example of telling and not showing spawn open with truckload of mumbo jumbo about force of darkness force of light and how men are the

agrees to command the devil army to overtake the world he ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda underused theresa randle and little girl cyan sydni beaudoin of course seeing a how five year ha passed wanda ha fallen for and married simmons partner b sweeney his uh shoulder to cry on come in the form of clown john leguizamo disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan clown manipulates simmons now in superhuman spawn form into stand off with wynn wynn who think he is in league with the double dealing clown recognizes spawn a threat and undergoes an operation where bomb is placed on his heart when it stop beating major city around the world will detonate causing the leak of disease that make the ebola virus look like skin rash phew got all that it would be easy to dismiss spawn a just another one of those heavy on fx short on substance action pic but it doesn even work on that level the computer generated sequence are often and plenty and the problem is that they look too computer generated the several scene set in hell present devil that look and act like video game graphic with the movie healthy budget you think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talk other element of the movie are so so spawn enormous red flowing cape is wonderful sight but it too obvious when he being played by costumed actor or an image in movie like contact the special effect serve the story in spawn they are the story and spawn himself isn even an interesting character the film reliance on razzle dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for but both simmons and his funky alter ego are completely underdeveloped what we need is batman luke skywalker even watching the adventure of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn poor leguizamo he starred in february the pest movie that still think is the year worst so far although this one doe give it run for it money a clown he overacts to the extreme never missing an opportunity for poor taste punchline leguizamo fart green mist munch pizza slice covered with maggot and even don mini skirt and performs cheerleader routine all before turning into giant grey demon the guy wa brilliant in to wong foo thanks for everything julie newmar what is he doing wasting his talent in this and the pest m one of the few people that liked batman robin this summer other big budget comic book film yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison can only hope people will change their mind and think of batman a the superior adaptation there a compelling story somewhere in spawn including strong religious overtone and the debut of the first african american superhero ever but it just not found anywhere near here a it is spawn is just awful

standard cop movie plot mixed with dash of john woo styled brotherhood moral and little gunplay capone tough a nail super cop get transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangster that have broken into his home while he wa with his lady and killed his partner in front of him when he arrives he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up ha gotten worse thanks mainly to the crime bos wonie jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw so named because his left hand ha been amputated and replaced by grasping hook capone discovers that wonie ha been smuggling gun inside shipment of charity supply for the area church and much to his disappointment also find out his childhood friend ratty mark danvers ha been helping him torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend capone must make some hard decision in order to make thing right again directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne assistant director for such american film a how stella got her groove back and instinct one hardly notice the film wa shot on video after while shot are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuance of the aforementioned john woo film although the action isn a hyperkinetic a most of woo film are the action scene are handled with kind of flair though and eventually begin to take on life of their own beyond the hong kong film that they are obviously patterned after the make up effect are particularly good in these scene a well with flawless squib work on display from the effect team the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue spoken with thick jamaican accent half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang just add to the interest paul campbell a the loose cannon capone essay his role perfectly displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right time mark danvers evokes sympathy a ratty the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football field and organizing block party to bring people together unfortunately carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character a the crime bos seems ineffective largely because his underling seem to run all over him but then again that could be the way his character wa intended to be portrayed the music in the film is composed of all reggae song and the soundtrack wa produced by grammy award winning artist sly and robbie who have worked with the like of the rolling stone maxi priest bob dylan james brown grace jones herbie hancock bootsy collins and carly simon among others the end credit song we run ting by the group red dragon is pretty decent and carry on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that open this review oddly enough desmond ballentine who play the character deportee is well known a pioneer in the realm of gangsta reggae a the performer ninjaman and he doesn contribute single song to the film that could see which is virtually unheard of here in the u at the time of this writing third world cop ha been put into limited theatrical release in the u coming off of six month box office breaking run in jamaica where it hold the position a highest grossing film of all time bringing in 21 million in jamaica which is roughly 500 000 u palm picture the company that released the offbeat but entertaining six string samurai is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market can imagine that disc will be available once the film ha left theater chris blackwell founder of palm picture wa also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in 1981 entitled countryman so d say he ha pretty good track record overall third world cop is pretty entertaining homage to the film of john woo ringo lam tsui hark and many other action film by director from hong kong if action film are your thing and you don mind intermittent subtitle then you can go wrong with this film the performance and the story are solid if only little cliched and the action is tight m not sure what the other jamaican film released in that country are like but apparently third world cop honor are well deserved\n","one can not observe star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy innocent fun sometimes the story are compelling sometimes they re not but with the exception of the first film in the series which provides little more than endless shot of amazed face ve never been bored by any of the enterprise numerous mission star trek insurrection is no exception the film ha gotten some negative review friend of mine actually think it the worst in the series but m not really sure why it an exciting often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film some say it a bit too light and more of long episode than film others say the special effect are cheesy and that it boring simply enjoyed the film insurrection which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast introduces u to race of people called the ba ku the ba ku are very old most of them are about three hundred year old but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the ring of their planet of course these peaceful people can horde this fountain of youth all for themselves leave it up to their archenemies the son led by ru afo murray abraham to mess everything up the son who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable strike deal with the federation to move the ba ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying that when captain picard patrick stewart step in he realizes that moving the ba ku would kill them it also help that he fall in love with ba ku woman donna murphy so with his trusty crew picard defies the federation to keep the ba ku in their natural habitat when dealing with series with a much history a this it not entirely necessary to re introduce your character with each episode this is why believe non fan have hard time getting into star trek in order to enjoy it one ha to understand how to approach it insurrection however doe surprisingly good job of u new aspect of the character stewart is bold a always magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together jonathan frakes who also directed is funny a commander riker subplot with data brent spiner discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting and abraham make perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact insurrection is an exciting film with some really attractive special effect and lot of good action this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation and the result is very pleasing to the eye particularly in the climactic scene in which the son employ giant space ship to suck up the ring of the ba ku planet the special effect have clean impressively sharp look if have any complaint about the film it that it try to take moral stance when it not very appropriate to do so don think it that big of deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba ku in order to save the life of thousand better yet why couldn they have co existed insurrection feel little to light to spring these kind of big moral question on the audience with it inherent camp factor the star trek series doesn seem well equipped to deal with issue like this prefer to just enjoy the spectacle\n","for those of u who

mama and the papa and jefferson airplane to the who this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy but give fair warning that will reveal the ending which doe not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time sure some have painted their face and smoke joint but a pennebaker the war room moon over broadway surprisingly chooses to show broad spectrum of the audience no matter who is watching it all come back to the talented musician that stir your soul the excitement start before the music even begin young girl is cleaning thousand of seat and when asked why by an interviewer she reply that she feel lucky to do so there are moment of organized craziness a john phillips leader of the mama and the papa and one of the concert organizer try to get in touch with dionne warwick and when one band is tuning up member remark finally decent sound system you can tell just by watching these first few moment that this show isn about vanity it about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it two way street this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience it impossible to tear your eye away from janis joplin a she belt out her ballad about love being ball and chain and while the lyric to wild thing may not be all that complicated watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is a captivating a otis redding singing about love even if you don recognize every band you see on stage you can imagine being a enthralled by their work a the public sitting in those seat the only drawback to the film is the ending which unfortunately must reveal all the other band big name then and still today got approximately 7 to 10 minute of screen time in contrast the last band on camera wholly forgettable one get an entire 18 minute of screen time for film that only 78 minute long that too large of chunk especially when previous act are much more stimulating all in all monterey pop is precious rare look at time period that still hold sway over u the variety of music a well a the beautifully shot performance are easy to become immersed in if there wa ever any question a to why most of these band were so popular this is quickly dispelled it

might expect cathartic viewing experience walking into new jean luc godard film after all he wa founding member of the highly influential french new wave he is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to u in much of his writing however his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the following four category meeting physical passion quarrel and reconciliation these four universal truth would be revealed through three different couple young adult and elderly it is edgar bruno putzulu self appointed task to capture these moment after recent breakup to define central idea it only when thing are over that they make sense whether this project will end up play film or opera remains undecided the thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone instead what ensues is an hour and half of repetitive vignette the next scene no more engaging than the last only once doe any character utter something worthwhile but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it but don fret it will surface again you could easily sleep through whole section of the film a some fellow critic did and wake up in scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile but you hold hope for some time the background music keep you in state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversation it only after repeated failure to pay any of this off that you lose all hope and with speech like am thinking of something but can only think of that something when am thinking of something else how can you expect to hold anyone interest to godard credit he certainly know how to frame scene the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful watching edgar read while walking along train track on mountain make you wish you had something to ponder along with him and if this film had anything poignant to say you would have which make you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunity the environment be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complement them unfortunately godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous time within any given scene sometimes these break are used for chapter heading but these are even more cryptic than the spoken word the second half is composed of nauseating hyper color that often blur the image you suddenly feel like doomed character straight out of scanner the only scene that make any sense is one that complains about the united state bastardizing history in the making of movie steven spielberg is picked on in particular while ll grant that this doe happen and tend to shy away from watching such garbage it still pointless focus for film that purport to articulate the specific quality of couplehood it just go to show an intelligent person isn necessarily an admirable storyteller the day of breathless are no more\n","lake placid mark yet another entry

the stomach for chomp em up flick the body count is surprisingly low and doesn include any of the major character and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it lake placid manages to have it both way ll let you discover how for yourself the croc itself is mostly computer generated of course like the snake in anaconda the thirty foot monster crocodile doesn seem real it move too quickly and in way that seem unnatural lake placid also offer little explanation for why giant crocodile is in maine there is lot of semi mystical mumbo jumbo about how we really don know much about crocodile they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligator in the sewer movie like this doesn have to offer much of an explanation radioactive mutant creature from outer space but it doe have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto pilot most of the time they re probably thinking about killing their agent or wondering if making this movie mark the end of their career platt and white on the other hand seem to be giving their best

the end credit this is one of the longest seeming 95 minute motion picture have recently endured basically hard rain is one extended dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot out there a lot of water broken glass gunfire and explosion it all very routine and uninteresting because there aren any real character and the plot only occasionally make sense the film conclusion is so preposterous that it almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film maker decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around action film are supposed to become progressively more invigorating a they rush towards conclusion graham yost the writer of both speed and hard rain surely understands that principle unfortunately neither he nor

doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movie one of which wa made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 under the title the island of lost soul sound like much better title the story begin with edward douglas thewlis un representative sent to oversee peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery kilmer after his plane crash into the sea douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr moreau who incidently owns the island and also reputable geneticist who ha been awarded the nobel prize his host reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau lab when monstrous birth wa in progress even worse the other worker in the lab are not exactly normal people douglas stumble across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast people community which considers dr moreau their maker using shock therapy and the law dr moreau ha long been able to keep his beast people civilised to some extent but there are few animal men who are just too savage to be controlled the island of dr moreau question the ability of men playing god dr moreau is man obsessed with creating race of being which is free from hate and violence but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long moreau ha no doubt very interesting premise within it grasp even so the production ha failed to make the most out of it there are too many character to put your attention to and the worst thing is the character are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather ungloriously at time too perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreau creation the two very important character montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreau obsession montgomery purpose in the story and justification to a why the beast people had to rebel maybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently doe not incorporate much action sequence in the film forced the filmmaker to cut long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else it still summer and movie have to be marketable the special effect too are really nothing for anyone to shout about at most would say the beast men looked just bit more realistic than those ape in planet of the ape this g well classic really ha potential to be good film unfortunately after 2 adaptation they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which make up the entire essence of the story a third outing the island of dr moreau accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of the planet of the ape the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good

out of doing whatever he or she intends to do life are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at moment notice the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being police officer he must be able to think on his foot and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower most of all the negotiator must be able to enter situation with a little intelligence about the scenario a possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really want it take pretty smart person to do that but what if the hostage holding criminal is just a smart what if he also able to think on his foot in fact what if he also know all the trick to turning the situation to his favor it is this circumstance which form the basis for gary gray the negotiator in this film police negotiator danny roman samuel jackson is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force when his partner turn up shot to death and internal affair find incriminating evidence in roman home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder faced with the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny by the medium roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scene in the captain office don quite remember if the captain actually said hate to do this but although it wouldn surprise me if he did luckily the film soon shake off the conventionalism and concentrate on the interesting premise mentioned above after being offered take it or leave it deal by the district attorney roman resolve to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affair inspector niebaum t walsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he ha been framed although roman action seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up gray redeems himself by involving u with the negotiation between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue jackson while superb actor is miscast in the role of roman the actor ha become so popular and so often identified a protagonist notable exception can be found such a in jackie brown that we a an audience have difficult time believing he will carry out his threat the script also clearly set him up a the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence how can we believe he going to shoot hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier unfortunately this preconception sap the film of some of it would be suspenseful moment and anything good left in those scene is largely attributed to jackson acting ability almost every time he in scene jackson steal it without looking back when spacey appears the film ha already run about third of it course his is an interesting character made out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him ha him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation can talk man out of blowing up the sears tower but can talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he say when he get the call to action however he quickly change gear and becomes the man we expect him to be soon his character ha to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agent who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiation fail this complex set of pressure are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor a the second protagonist spacey measure up nicely gray really lucked out with this cast david morse a commander beck ron rifkin a commander frost and john spencer a police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scene with jackson and spacey the only problem is the bit of typecasting that result from these choice morse played similar role in the rock rifkin played the a in a confidential and spencer played police detective in cop land with the level of acting however this can be forgiven also in the supporting cast paul giamatti a rudy one of the hostage is notable for the comic relief he provides his character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just look so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even say anything fortunately this doesn distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breather from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout t walsh a the suspicious internal affair inspector clock in with one of his final performance sadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film walsh appeared in dozen of movie such a good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon for one of his best performance check out sling blade in which he play mental patient sharing ward with billy bob thornton when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh wa one of the men to whom he credited his success the actor performed together in few good men the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had

understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald who hasn made worthwhile film since 1986 but the fact is betsy wedding is also an alan alda film and while ringwald ha been making dud for the last four year alda ha been involved with several noteworthy project including crime and misdemeanor and new life written and directed by alda betsy wedding is vibrant slice of life mixing few dramatic moment into big bowl of whimsical humor alda comic elixir is smooth and refreshing and welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare a bride and groom molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal character in the film but they are by far the least interesting walsh is nonentity with all the screen presence of door knob ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain she look hideous with her short cropped orange hair red lip stick and grotesque outfit she supposed to be dress designer but she look more like clown and to make matter worse ringwald performance match her appearance thankfully alda keep ringwald screen time to minimum he is far more interested in the colorful periphery character the wedding is just device to bring together the bride working class italian family and the groom rich gentile family ringwald folk are homey and down to earth with alda a her free spirited father madeline kahn a her practical mother and ally sheedy a her lonely sister walsh clan on the other hand is prim proper and ostentatious when the two family meet and mingle the movie becomes story of culture clash or a one character put it money versus value ally sheedy in wonderfully understated performance is one of the film most pleasant surprise sheedy express more with just her eye than ringwald doe with her entire body it anthony lapaglia however who seizes the spotlight lapaglia play stevie dee suave overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry lapaglia sincere but dim witted character is riot and what uncanny is that lapaglia is dead ringer for robert de niro with little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting and his inspired performance is partly tribute to his role model and partly rip off don know whether to say star is born or star is re born but do know that lapaglia over the top performance should not be missed the scrumptious comic acting however extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia joe pesci in particular sink his teeth into his role a alda unscrupulous brother in law slum lord with mob tie who is cheating on his wife catherine hara alda faced with challenge of both directing and acting somehow find just the right comic touch a the bride financially strapped father carpenter whose dream are bigger than his wallet the film adopts alda psychological point of view a he try to one plan the wedding and two pay for it a filmmaker alda style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful and while he doesn have the comic genius of woody allen alda doe posse the inspiration to make movie which are ten time more entertaining than the slop which usually pass for comedy\n","and now the high flying hong kong style of filmmaking ha made it way down to the classic and it isn pretty this time out the nod to asia go by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer version of duma the three musketeer by bringing in popular asian actor stunt coordinator xing xing xiong whose only prior american attempt at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez our musketeer are thrown into the air to do their fighting the end result is tepid and dull action adventure rip off that stink of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay artagnan justin chamber is the vengeful son of slain musketeer he travel to paris to join the royal musketeer and find the man that killed his parent in paris he meet the cunning cardinal richelieu stephen rea who is trying to overthrow the king and richelieu man in black associate febre tim roth the killer of his folk he find the musketeer in paris disbanded and drunk so he round up aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steven spiers to free the musketeer wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king prison artagnan and his new frisky love interest chambermaid francesca mena suvari play footsy and coo at each other a the cardinal hunt down the musketeer until finally the queen catherine deneuve end up being captured by the menancing febre forcing the musketeer to regroup with artagnan leading the charge and save the day director peter hyams end of day obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking style but here it a disaster one problem is that in reality most eastern film have taken their lead from western one jet li high risk is rip off of die hard not the other way around ironically there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all maybe ten minute of swashbuckling spread over five scene most asian action film carry the bulk of their production with 20 to 30 minute action sequence because they know the scene have to carry the picture the musketeer instead weighs itself down with predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano sudden death horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth and the prosaic attempt of justin chamber the wedding planner to deliver his mousy self a leader chamber artangnan isn a musketeer he a mouseketeer and hyam use of candle and torch to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well noted but that the only standout in an overall flat production\n","that thing you do tom hank screenwriting and directorial debut that thing you do ha all the quality you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment fun lively

deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 which hank call the last innocent year the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and setting but also in the music which like the other recent period music film grace of my heart wa expressly written for the film hank himself had hand in writing four of the tune but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credit have rolled it still playing in my mind a write this it should come a no surprise that hank the director work well with the actor eliciting charming likable work from the entire cast most notably hank lookalike scott and tyler who is remarkable in delivering the film biggest and best dramatic moment the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince a teen of the early 60 they do not appear to be 90 grungers playacting retro yet for all the light frothy charm of that thing you do it nearly nice to fault while this unbridled innocence in film is refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these day there is not enough conflict to keep thing consistently interesting everyone is so happy basking in the glow of overnight success marvelling at it all except toward the end but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness ending on an appropriately feel good note there isn much of an edge throughout that thing the only thing that is remotely edgy is hank turn a the wonder manager and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it bland but little niceness go long way these day and there no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do it just about impossible to hate it an inoffensive enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audience smiling and humming if not singing that thing you do quite possibly for day to paraphrase passage from the song though try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play that thing you do\n","the event of event is upon u people have waited twenty two year for the prequel to star war and die hard fan have been camping out at theater for month to get ticket to see it don think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of film ha caused it is not bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history anyone who tell you it just movie is either lying or clueless it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz which is far too weak word that star war epsode the phantom menace so effortlessly generated but that doe not mean that the film itself is bad in fact it is terrific strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the medium machine and the inevitable backlash it is set some decade before the event of the original 1977 star war took place the film focus on the fledgling republic of planet and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that wa recently put in place ha invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo the republic sent two jedi knight people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known a the force qui gon jinni liam neeson and obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor to negotiate unable to stop the tide of event that wa about to occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene on the way they get sidetracked to planet called tatooine where they meet the movie real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd he is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong with him so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained a jedi a any self respecting star war fan should know anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor movie around 70 of the character if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effect are seamless the movie lack soul think that although the computer ha played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this this is the lightest installment in the star war saga thus far with plenty of broad comic relief to go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar jar binks he essentially computer animated sidekick who say thing like exqueeze me and mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying the visual effect are astounding although director george lucas often chicken out by cutting away from them and the movie is thrilling triumph if it lack in plot and in acting it make up for it through imagination and excitement the climactic lightsaber battle oh come on a if you didn already know among other thing is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie what made me surrender and give this movie 1 2 star wa the score by john williams even though it doe seem like the man score every single movie that come out these day his work here is nothing short of brilliant his use of opera during the climax really doe add punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march a sort of prophecy is chilling the phantom menace is probably most effective a pop nostalgia when you see long time ago in galaxy far far away when the familiar music play when the word star war appear on screen you ll feel tingle even if you didn see the movie when it first came out in 77 it feel oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi master aspire to get him trained in the jedi art we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not we not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like we re seeing the beginning of saga that we have cherished for year the phantom menace although lacking in human aspect of the story is very worthy installment in the star war it work a an action flick visually eye popping and often paralyzingly exciting it also work a an elicitor of memory piece of exquisite

outskirt of brazil where unpaved road religious devotee and the poverty stricken become commonplace film like this remind me a to what enjoy about some foreign film it is an opportunity for me to get fresh breath in another part of the world so distant from my own it doe so entertainingly and so heart wrenchingly and yet it backdrop is merely that the focus is on the minute transformation of dora of how she learns to love this little kid without being cloying or sentimental the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film dora being an amoral scam artist could

affection for non drinking evangelical who see the problem with dora if not initially fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance but the true marvel is

only because it wa directed by robert ginty star of the grade action film of the previous decade those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movie that made ginty the star a director ginty did very little to improve that impression the protagonist of the movie is jack played by jeff fahey yacht skipper that fall madly in love with christina ford played by bo derek however she ha relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer one stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder however his good friend walter hill robert mitchum happens to be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar film by having almost all character behaving like total idiot unfortunately this film isn comedy and any laugh is unintentional the character are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them the actor that play them don help either that is especially the case with jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man look like genius in comparison his partner bo derek on the other hand show that she didn age enough to cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talent ginty on the other hand try to bring some life in the movie by using many flashback and strange angle of shooting but in the end it get only irritating to the already bored and

no the source of potential sleeplessness here lie within the movie brutally squandered potential the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise even by tired serial killer genre standard the big letdown however come upon the realization that this 100 minute head scratcher wa masterminded by neil jordan the man behind the cry game he no stranger to cinematic weirdness but this nutty nonsense really push the envelope thing start out strong enough with cinematographer darius khondji stunning camera work guiding viewer into the bowel of underwater ghost town during creepy prologue that establishes notably grim tone right off the bat this eerie opulence remains dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film there even something macabre about the way khondji photograph

instantaneously present the main message of the entire film the shot ha tibbs face completely covered by the shadow of the prison bar to see these bar blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the character in the film a black detective conducting an investigation in southern town full of violent white bigot no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigot a threat simply because of the color of his skin the bar show that tibbs ha not been given fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him a different and dangerous this one shot amazes me because it capture whole theme in matter of second it perhaps may be the most powerful image have seen in film in the heat of the night wa the first and the best of the three film norman jewison directed concerning racism in america jewison ha very keen style of displaying various case of racism a he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental in these three film he doe an excellent job creating very detailed equal analysis of character from the abused to the abuser he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society wa in the past and is in the present preceding the very original soldier story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic line and some very memorable character the film which won best picture in 1967 focus on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuse to give up on an investigation in white town where is he not wanted tibbs is man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chain tibbs is the perfect protagonist poitier also give an excellent noteworthy voice to his character never nervous and always commanding his speech pattern are very manipulative a they range from stentorian to soothing however unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier share the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance a sheriff who help tibbs and warns him of the danger around him steiger show great amount of skill in his role he start off a racist and blind a the other townspeople he would refer to tibbs a boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him a the film progress though there is very gradual change in the sheriff he begin to see the hardship tibbs face and he see the foolishness of his own neighbor what really enjoyed about steiger character wa that he did not completely abandon his friend or connect with tibbs at the end of the film he still could not refer to tibbs a mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil instead it wa apparent that he wa eventually going to see the world differently in the future most movie would have character reversing all of his belief and influence in matter of minute this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day jewison determination to make this film a realistic a possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate in the heat of the night show the difference between the north and the south or major city and small town in the united state during the 1960 it display this perfectly however the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lack interest it seemed rushed especially towards the end a if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving credible explanation involving the murder victim there were way too many character added during the last fifteen minute and some of the scene during this time period were inane police officer sam being suspect wa not needed also it is given that tibbs is vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he doe but some of his discovery came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case detail towards the end were never answered the rushed ending wa the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic congratulation ha to be given to actor scott wilson he managed to be in the two best movie of 1967 in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood\n","plot young french boy see his parent killed before his eye by tim roth oops mean an evil man he vow revenge on that man and is taught the way of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself anyway fourteen year go by and arrgh well you know the rest swish swish zzzzzzz critique this is pretty bad movie let see where should start okay first of all the story is just plain boring it not original is entirely predictable and lack energy okay what next acting you say hmmmm well the main actor justin chamber is basically an uncharismatic version of chris donnell but with le range think about that and mena suvari is just plain off not a bad a thora birch wa in dungeon dragon but entirely miscast with bad delivery awful sequence and piss poor accent that come and go now m not sure if this wa m suvari fault or the director but ve definitely seen her at much higher level than in this film the only semi saving grace actor wise is tim roth a the irrepressible bad guy but once again it not something that we haven seen before thousand time by the same guy tim please for the love of god beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day american role for you a nice guy in romantic comedy or something stretch dude stretch we all know that you can do much better than this gunk alright what else wa bad in this film oh yeah the score yikes how about taking it down few notch there fella this thing blare in your ear whenever it feel the need to accentuate certain scene but actually doe little more than annoy think it important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn a real epic by any stretch of the imagination it a fluffy rehashed cake walk created by some shrewd studio head who decided to take advantage of the whole kung fu phenomenon in film and test it out on an old classic dude you failed all around keep reading the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problem plentiful why doe the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent take forever scampering his way back to the top why don they just cut the mouseketeer rope at the top of the tower instead of jumping down on their own chord and fighting him while hanging why doesn anybody look day older when the sequence say 14 year later at least change your shirt man keep in mind that have never strayed away from championing certain movie that are created simply for the sake of fun time but this flick just didn cut it for me it wa boring for stretch the acting wa atrocious at time the romantic scene between suvari and chamber next to the lake reminded me of play in high school which made you cringe there wa little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeer fat will give the movie this much and that is that it main reason for being it raison etre a the french would say it fight sequence do come through despite the lack of their number in the film wa hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork a promoted in it trailer but what you see there are essentially the snippet from the two major and cool swashbuckling sequence from the film the first come right at the beginning of the movie while the other essentially finish the film off hanging from the tower and juggling off ladder the ladder sequence itself is definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film credit hullo the film is called the musketeer and star dude name justin chamber deneuve is barely in this movie ugh just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash now say it together gang all for one and one for all we vow to stay away from it all thank me later where joblo coming from knight tale 7 10 american outlaw 5 10 crouching tiger hidden dragon 7 10 the matrix 8 10 the replacement killer 6 10 romeo must die 3 10

brings his new horror film mant to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis he hope to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town we see most of the event through the story of four teenager and how life affect them quick and easy review really enjoyed matinee the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely unlike many comedy this film try and succeeds in getting past the stage of doing anything for laugh the maker of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story the performance of all the principal are right on the mark particularly john goodman a the schlock master so would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for light hearted yet interesting way to spend couple of hour longer more detailed review beware of spoiler the primary reason enjoyed this film wa that while being comedy the film also had an intelligent story to tell too many comedy today subscribe to the the notion that comedy need only make you laugh you watch the movie laugh lot leave the theatre and take nothing with you matinee is not like that left the picture thinking about what would do faced with the cuban missile crisis found myself wondering what would happen to the character of the film but most importantly found myself caring about what would happen to the character the comedy of the film center around goodman his character and the film he brings to key west believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actor in the business today he is highly expressive both physically and vocally felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink the other character are often lost in scene with him due to his commanding nature however while the star goodman is actually not at the center of the film the movie is really the story of the four teenager discovering who they are and what they want against background where at any minute it could all end thought the kid reaction were highly realistic they tried to block it out they tried to escape from the concern of their world unfortunately it kept creeping back in particularly with the fear and the chaos of the time while the comedy centered on goodman and the drama on the teen there wa great deal of overlap several aspect of the panic are shown in humorous light one example is scene where people are fighting each other for the the last can and box of food in grocery store if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for comedy but it work here another reason like this film is that like science fiction movie one of my favorite film to go watch is plan 9 from outer space note did not say it wa one of my favorite movie but one of my favorite to see while mant never got made many film like it were and mant serf mostly a dante homage to the film he love so again would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for good humorous story this isn a gag film like many other comedy but an intelligent well thought out film about real people with real problem told in an often hilarious way enjoy\n","carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion made in 1972 it still feature most of the regular of this genre sid james play the head of gang of crook intent on stealing contraceptive pill from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make profit kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting head of the hospital but also hypochondriac hattie jacques re take her role a matron and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr goode the joke come in fast and so do the laugh with humorous antic between the matron and sir bernard this time williams is after matron jacques when he need to prove himself that he is man after visiting dr goode the doctor hawtrey is sworn to secrecy assure you that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other bernard think he is having sex change and need to prove himself there are great cameo from joan sims an expectant mother who is many week overdue and is eating constantly in every scene and from kenneth connor a the expectant father who still think he at work at the railway station sid james gang including cyril his son kenneth cope try to find out where the pill are by getting cyril to dress up a nurse and live in at the nurse home he ha to share room with nurse ball barbara windsor and she soon see through him the film end with the attempted robbery of the hospital pill with panic ensuing there are good performance by hattie jacques a the matron however her character seems little more subdued and quieter than her previous matron williams is a usual on top form but sid james isn given very good part in this movie and would forgive anyone to forget that he wa in the movie at all the same doe not go for charles hawtrey for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minute gone and ha scarce screen time he seems to steal every scene he is in by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor talent to full effect the film seems to flounder but it certainly make up for it with it good storyline and it other appealing character this film is genuinely funny and could watch it again and again and not get bored\n","synopsis in this movie steven spielberg one of today finest director attempt to spice up the 1800s story of long courtroom

potential world renowned anthropologist ethan powell anthony hopkins disappeared for two year whilst doing research in the jungle of africa he wa found and is coming back to the united state convicted killer he murdered to african policeman who were allegedly trying to capture him after committing few more brutal act of violence in the airport the authority stick him in prison psychotic ward assigned to do an evaluation on powell is bright or so we are told young psychiatrist theo caulder cuba gooding jr caulder start out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career of course and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way he start really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not psychotic and that he should not be in prison and then there the inevitable heartless meanie character in the form of donald sutherland who play caulder mentor he care for caulder but doe everything he can to discourage him from helping powell let get one thing straight dr theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist have ever seen on screen or off any good shrink will listen to what his patient ha to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn great deal about his patient that way not good old theo no he asks purposefully pointed question and when powell dare to venture to another subject caulder say we need to talk about this right now this is flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct already dubious credibility unfortunately it also the least of it problem director jon turteltaub who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon a well a the surprisingly above par cool running decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that contrary to what this movie promotion would have you believe it ha much more in common with patch adam than with the silence of the lamb it not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tear to your eye what dream may come aptly demonstrated that but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus excuse the graphic depiction it aim to inspire rather than to touch heart a yoda would say inspire it doe not it is the ultimate sign of futility when screenwriter the very experienced gerald di pego ha to resort to literally telling the audience movie story indeed somewhere in the beginning of instinct one of the character actually read aloud the film plot to another character this like the instance mentioned in the first paragraph of this review is horrid insult to our intelligence am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actor and he chew the scenery in this movie brilliant a ever oscar winner cuba gooding jr on the other hand is dreadful his performance is at least part of what make his character seem so incapable of being shrink liked the guy in jerry maguire a well a in a good a it get but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling love animal and instinct prominent save the gorilla live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something could sympathize with however this movie execution is completely unacceptable tone down the violence and this will be chick flick 1999 eugene novikov\n","i currently accepting all future name for drew barrymore character in _the wedding singer_ she wa julia gulia in _never been kissed_ she josie grossie future db character name include janet granite janey grainy and for that nc 17 project in the work jo jo aw forget it ll stick to my day job this is teen movie all right except the main character aren teen drew barrymore is copy editor at the chicago sun time who get her big break a reporter only it very clear from the onset that she lack the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that mark the best of reporter the story she covering is not really story but story in the making she is to return to high school a student and explain what really going on the irony is that drew character wa such dweeb first time around that she is terrified at going back when she doe she say the wrong thing wear the wrong clothes and project the know the answer in class that popular kid or at least popular kid in the movie reject at least she befriends nerdy aldys joan of arc leelee sobieski watch for her who turn out to be more beautiful than those who are supposed to be more beautiful than her what work drew geeky old self after start in film that wa headline driven and nadir of role that had her play the sluttish character it a surprise to see her with bad hair big glass and brace it very funny what doesn work drew geeky new self come on nobody dress a bad a she doe couldn she just go to _the gap_ and take suggestion had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better the comedy is supposed to progress when drew younger brother played with zest by david arquette reenlists to jump start his baseball career now how in the world can somebody a nerdy but in funny way a he can be the most popular kid in the school in day the dialogue in the film is well an embarrassment her co worker molly shannon john reilly and gary marshall are in terminal hyper drive her teenage peer except sobieski are so inept and stupid that there little bite from them couldn the filmmaker watch _heathers_ first lastly am proud to say that caught significant gaffe in the film if you see the film you know what m talking about drew walk into bar ha her hand stamped and over the night associate with some rastafarian with some delicious um cake she go wild sleep in late when she wake she rush off to school without showering without noticing that her head lying on her stamped hand all night ha transferred part of the stamp image to her forehead spelling loser funny eh except that the hand would have transferred

police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . \n","the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . \n","you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . \n","we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . \n","in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . \n","shakur and roth play ezekiel \" spoon \" whitmore and alexander \" stretch \" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . \n","when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . \n","they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . \n","as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . \n","the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . \n","in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . \n","gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . \n","in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . \n","and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . \n","one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , \" do you expect the world to stop . . . just \n","because you picked _today_ to clean up ? \" \n","the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . \n","hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . \n","a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . \n","in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . \n","the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . \n","hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . \n","oh , the irony of it . \n","tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . \n","in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . \n","spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . \n","mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . \n","it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy . \n","gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch \" helping \" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . \n","with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . \n","the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again . \n","\n","[533, 3783, 12, 1, 2376, 220, 54, 32, 254, 15, 1, 315, 20, 1, 1743, 5, 1, 1744, 1, 1350, 255, 804, 7, 79, 20, 106, 23,
