# Dataset

## Introduction
As a sharing economy product, Airbnb experiences a rapid development in recent decades. Airbnb is an alternative hotel business that shares the accommodation with others, short period or long period. There are lots of research on the price per night that Airbnb costs.In \cite{chen2017consumer}, a wide array of utility-bearing attributes of Airbnb listings and the effects of these attributes on consumers’ valuation in United States are measured. It provides a comprehensive study on the pricing of Airbnb listed properties and the results explain how the factors, i.e., listing functionality, attributes of hosts, customers reviews and market conditions affect the price. Another research in \cite{cai2019price} focuses on the market of Hong Kong. Five groups’ variables were collected, i.e., listing attributes, host attributes, rental policies, listing reputation, and listing location to investigate the determinant of Airbnb price. Some use ordinary least square regression with geographically-weighted, which is introduced in \cite{voltes2020drivers}, to study the factors that affect the price for different room types, i.e., entire room or private room. 

In this project, we are going to build a suitable model that can explain the relationship between the rental price per night posted on Airbnb of apartment in the Netherlands, mainly in the city of Amsterdam,  and several characteristics related to the apartment. Specially, to find the determinants of the price from the room features, e.g., number of bathrooms, bedrooms; host response rate, and the ratings received from the customers.



## Description of dataset
The dataset to be analyzed is collected from https://data.world/cannata/gaairbnb and is named "AirBNB.csv". In the raw dataset, there are 7833 observations on 41 variables. The selected variables to be analyzed are price, accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, room_type, host_response_rate and review_scores_rating. The description and type of each variable are listed as follows.  
price: continuous variable, the price per night posted on the website.  
accommodates: discrete variable, the number of guests that the property can accept.  
bathrooms: continuous variable, the number of bathrooms the property has.  
bedrooms: discrete variable, the number of bedrooms the property has.  
room_type: nominal variable, the feature of the shared property, and there are three types, "Entire home/apt", "Private room" and "Shared room".
host_response_rate: continuous variable, indicating the response frequency of the host when receiving message.  
review_scores_rating: discrete variable, indicating the reputation of the shared property.  

The screenshot of the dataset is displayed in Figure 1.  
As for the data wrangling, we propose to filter out the observations related to property type "apartment" first, then select the necessary variables. At last removing the observations with missing values and changing the format or type of some variables.

## Three proposed research questions

### Research question 1
The first proposed question: “Are the average prices per night the same for different room type?”

### Research question 2
The second proposed question: "Is there a linear relationship between price per night and accommodates, if there is, how to interpret the relationship?

### Research question 3
The third proposed question: "Is there a multiple linear relationship between price per night and a group of predictors. i.e., accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, room_type, host_response_rate and review_scores_rating?

# Data Import and Cleaning 

In this section, we are going to prepare a well-structured dataset for subsequent analytics, which contains three steps, import, cleaning and tidy. 
Since the raw data is in "csv" format. We use the function "read.csv" to import the data. Then we filter out the observations related to property type "Apartment". 
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# import dataset and filter out apartment
tb<-read.csv("AirBnb.csv") %>% 
  filter(property_type=="Apartment")
```

There are lots of variables that we don't use, we select some specified columns by name to make the dataset more concise. 
```{r}
# select the necessary variables
tb.selected<-tb %>% 
  select(price,accommodates,bathrooms,bedrooms,room_type,
                host_response_rate,review_scores_rating)

str(tb.selected)
```
Given a view of the selected variables, we found that there are some variables in wrong type. For example, the variable price and host_response_rate should be numerical but they were in character type. 
```{r warning=FALSE}
# change the type of some variables 
tb.selected$price<-parse_number(tb.selected$price)
tb.selected$host_response_rate<-as.numeric(tb.selected$host_response_rate)
```

The last step is to tidy the missing values. Since the sample size is large, we are going to remove the observations with missing value in any column.  
```{r}
# remove the observations having missing values
tb.clean<-tb.selected %>% na.omit()
```

Here we take a view of the prepared dataset with dimension 4568 * 7. It is demonstrated that each variable have its own column, each observation has its own row and each value has its own cell. The three rules of tidy data is satisfied.  
```{r}
kable(head(tb.clean))
```

# Data Analysis

## Research question 1
The objective is to analyze whether the Airbnb posted price per night of apartment are different among different room types. Since the room type is a categorical variable, a one-way ANOVA approach is suitable. Before conducting any statistical analysis, a descriptive summary for the price is tabulated in Table 1. It is found that the average price `r round(mean(tb.clean$price[which(tb.clean$room_type=="Entire home/apt")]),0)` for the Entire home or entire apartment is much higher than that for private room `r round(mean(tb.clean$price[which(tb.clean$room_type=="Private room")]),0)` and shared room `r round(mean(tb.clean$price[which(tb.clean$room_type=="Shared room")]),0)`. Meanwhile, the variability of the price for entire home is also the highest. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
# descriptive summary of price for each room type
price.avg<-tb.clean %>% group_by(room_type) %>% 
  summarise(average=mean(price),
            SD=sd(price))
```

```{r kable_summaryPrice, echo=FALSE}
#Different alignment options, number of digits,  and a caption
kable(price.avg, align="lcrlll", #normally use r alignment for numbers
      digits=2,
      caption = "Summary statistics for price per night for different room types")
```

The boxplot displayed in Figure 2 gives a direct comparison of the distribution of price for each room type. The median for price of an entire home/apt is `r median(tb.clean$price[which(tb.clean$room_type=="Entire home/apt")])`, which is much higher than the upper quartile for price of private room and shared room, which are `r quantile(tb.clean$price[which(tb.clean$room_type=="Private room")],0.75)` and `r quantile(tb.clean$price[which(tb.clean$room_type=="Shared room")],0.75)`, respectively. The comparison results are as expected because the entire room provides more private space and usable area, and more costs are charged accordingly. Moreover, there are lots of extreme high outliers for the price of entire room. The range is quite large, which indicates there are lots of luxury property you can rent from Airbnb.  
The ANOVA analysis yields the p-value is below 0.05, which means that the average prices are significantly different among different room types. 

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Boxplot for price per night "}
boxplot(price~room_type,data=tb.clean,xlab="room type",ylab="price per night")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
model.aov<-aov(price~room_type,data=tb.clean)
aov.smy<-summary(model.aov)
```

## Research question 2
The object is to find whether there is a linear relationship between price per night and the number of guests that the shared property can hold. Figure 3 displays the scatter plot between the two variables. It is noted that there is an increasing trend for the price when accommodates value increases. And it seems the relationship is linear. Simple linear regression is a model that describes the relationship between one dependent and one independent variable using a straight line. Through the fitted model, the estimated coefficient on each variable indicates the association between response variable price and the predictor. The regression model is
$$price=\beta_0+\beta_1*accommodates+\epsilon \ \ \ \ \ \ (model \ 1)$$

```{r scatterplot, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Scatter plot between price and accommodates"}
plot(price~accommodates, data=tb.clean,ylab="price per night")
```

```{r model_summary, echo=FALSE}
fit1<-lm(price~accommodates,data=tb.clean)

out1<- tidy(fit1) %>%  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 3)

kable(out1,caption = "Regression summary for model 1")

```

Table 2 lists the regression summary. It is found that the accommodates has significant effect on the performance of price. The estimated coefficient on variable accommodates is `r  out1[2,2]`, which is positive, and it indicates when the number of accommodates increase one person, the price per night is expected to increase `r  out1[2,2]` dollars. The coefficient of determination is around `r round(summary(fit1)$r.squared,2)`, that about 31% variation of the price can be explained by variable accommodates. 


\newpage
## Research question 3
```{r echo=FALSE}
fit2<-lm(price~.,data=tb.clean)

out2<-tidy(fit2) %>%  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 3)

kable(out2,caption = "Regression summary for model 2")
```
The purpose is to add more explanatory variables to the simple model, and to find whether there is a multiple linear relationship between dependent variable price and all the predictors. Table 3 presents the regression summary. We can notice that except the variable host response rate, all the other estimated coefficients are statistically significant at 5% level. In general, accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms and review scores rating have positive effect on the prices. Compared to model 1, the estimated coefficient on accommodates decreases to `r out2[2,2]`, because other factors also have effects on the price. As for the categorical variable room type, there are three levels. In the model, entire room serves as the baseline level, therefore, the negative coefficients on private room and shared room means holding other variables constant, the entire rooms cost the highest price per night. The coefficient of determination increases to `r round(summary(fit1)$r.squared,2)`, hence the model with more predictors can explain more variability of the dependent variable. Model 2 has a better goodness of fit. 



For the assumptions' assessment for the linear regression, Figure 4 displays the residuals diagnostics. The left panel shows that the residuals display a fanning pattern with increasing spread. And in the right panel, the QQ plot tells the majority of the points are aligned with the diagonal line, but there are some deviations on both tails. Considering the large sample size, the normality assumption is considered moderately hold.  
```{r residualplot, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Residuals plots for model 2"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# residual plot
e_hat2<-resid(fit2)
plot(x=fitted(fit2),y=e_hat2,main="Residual vs Fitted",ylab="Residuals",xlab="Fitted")
# normal QQ plot
qqnorm(e_hat2)
qqline(e_hat2)
```

# Conclusion and Discussion

In this report, we have built a linear regression model with price as a response, room features, host services and accommodates ratings as the predictors. Regarding the estimated coefficients, number of accommodates, bathroom, bedrooms, host response rate and review scores rating have positive effect on the price per night, which is consistent with the results of the peer-reviewed articles. The coefficients on room type are negative, considering the base group is Entire room/apt, we can conclude that the entire room/apartment costs higher average price than private or shared room.
The limitations of analysis lie in the assessment of assumptions for the regression model. The residuals are not randomly scattered round the horizontal zero line, which may cause the incorrect or misleading of the inference analysis using the estimated model. For the future research, it is suggested to do some data transformation if the distribution of the dependent variable is not a normal one, logarithm transform is a good way and a log-linear model could be fitted.
